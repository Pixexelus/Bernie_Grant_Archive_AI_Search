Political career
In the mid-1960s, he was, for a period, a member of the Socialist Labour League, led by Gerry Healy. This later became known as the Workers Revolutionary Party. He quickly became a trade union official, and moved into politics, becoming a Labour councillor in the London Borough of Haringey in 1978.

When the Conservative government introduced "rate capping", Grant led the rate-capping rebellion in the borough in 1984.[3] This created division in the local Constituency Labour Party, but through this split, Grant became the Borough of Haringey leader in 1985.

Grant was associated with the Socialist Campaign Group, and spoke out against police racism.[4]

As council leader during the 1985 Broadwater Farm riot, in which policeman PC Keith Blakelock was murdered, Grant was brought to national attention when he gave a speech outside Tottenham Town Hall, in which he was widely misquoted as saying "The police were to blame for what happened on Sunday night and what they got was a bloody good hiding"[5][1][6] â€“ his actual words were "the youth think they gave the police a bloody good hiding".[7][8] His comments brought swift denunciation from the Labour Party leadership, and the then Conservative Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd, called him "the high priest of conflict"; several British newspapers also dubbed him "Barmy Bernie". Grant claimed that he was merely explaining to a wider audience what the feeling on the estate was like. He claimed his words had been taken out of context, but offered an apology to the family of PC Blakelock.[citation needed] There is conflicting information over whether Grant condemned the violence of the rioters the following day.[9][3][10] To some, Grant was an extremist, yet he supported the prosecution of 45 people subsequently charged with riot and affray.[11]

The controversy did not prevent him from being elected as MP for Tottenham at the 1987 general election, one of the UK's first Black British MPs since the Liberal Peter McLagan in the 19th century, all of them members of the Labour Party Black Sections movement, being elected at the same time as Diane Abbott and Paul Boateng, as well as Britain's first British Asian MP since the 1920s, Keith Vaz. Grant later stood for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party, but was unsuccessful.

In 1989, he established and chaired the Parliamentary Black Caucus, modelled after the Congressional Black Caucus of the United States. The organisation was committed to advancing the opportunities of Britain's ethnic minority communities.[12]
