Blue plaque dedicated to Grant at Tottenham Old Town Hall
In September 2007, in Tottenham, Haringey Council opened the Bernie Grant Arts Centre in his name.[19] On Sunday, 28 October 2012, a blue plaque, organised by the Nubian Jak Community Trust, was unveiled at Tottenham Old Town Hall in tribute to Grant.[20] On 5 December 2017, a portrait of Grant was unveiled in Parliament. The portrait was commissioned by the Speaker's Advisory Committee on Works of Art. Drawn in 180 hours using pencil and charcoal by hyper-realist artist Kelvin Okafor, the portrait joined the Parliamentary Art Collection.[citation needed]

In March 2019, the Labour Party launched the Bernie Grant Leadership programme, which was created to train and equip BAME Labour members.[21] Dawn Butler wrote on the launch that "This national programme is about empowering more Black, Asian, minority ethnic members to take on leadership positions in the Labour Party, develop skills and join a network of talented members and community activists across the country", saying that Grant "campaigned tirelessly for the elimination of racism both in Britain and across the world. ... He was a champion of his community, a dedicated constituency MP and has encouraged a generation of BAME leaders."[22]

Grant's archive is held at the Bishopsgate Institute.[23] Much of Grant's life work and community contributions can be found in articles, newspaper clippings at the archives of the George Padmore Institute, an organisation committed to preserving the cultural contributions of Caribbean, African and Asian descent in Britain and Europe.[24]
