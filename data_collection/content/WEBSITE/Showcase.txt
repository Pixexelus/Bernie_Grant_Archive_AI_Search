As chair of African Reparations Movement, Bernie Grant was keenly aware of the importance of history and heritage for African diaspora peoples:
‘Only if we understand our past can we as Black People move forward in the future. We must demand compensation for the biggest crime in history – the colonization and enslavement of our people.’
Anyone interested in exploring the life and times of Bernie Grant will find much that is of interest in this fascinating collection of papers, photographs, books and audio-visual material. But the Bernie Grant Archive does more than give insights in to the work of the well-known politician. It helps us to understand how perspectives on issues change, and why policies and practices develop in the way they do. Due to Bernie Grant’s tireless campaigning of behalf of numerous diverse communities, many individuals can also find something that’s relevant to their history in his archives.
The 70 cubic feet of items held within the Bernie Grant Archive come in a variety of formats and cover an extensive range of activities, as undertaken by Bernie Grant, on a local, national and global scale. The following is just a visual taster of some of the many remarkable items to be explored whilst visiting the Bernie Grant Archive:
