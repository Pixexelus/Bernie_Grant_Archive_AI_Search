A chronology of Bernie Grant
This chronology is not intended to provide a comprehensive account of the life of Bernie Grant, but to provide a general timeline and indication of the range and extent of his work. In particular it does not include the many hundreds of local issues which he raised over a long career, which are documented in the collection. Neither does it include references to his many Parliamentary interventions, which can be found by clicking the link to the Hansard website atwww.parliament.uk, and typingBernie Grantinto the search engine.
