            "African Reparations Movement\nIn 1993, Grant co-founded and chaired the African Reparations Movement (ARM UK) to campaign for the movement for reparations for slavery and racism. ARM UK was formed following the 1993 Abuja Proclamation declared at the First Pan-African Conference on Reparations, in Abuja, Nigeria, convened by the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and the Nigerian government. On 10 May 1993 Grant tabled a motion in the House of Commons that the House welcomed the proclamation and \"calls upon the international community to recognise that the unprecedented moral debt owed to African people has yet to be paid, and urges all those countries who were enriched by enslavement and colonisation to review the case for reparations to be paid to Africa and to Africans in the Diaspora; acknowledges the continuing painful economic and personal consequences of the exploitation of Africa and Africans in the Diaspora and the racism it has generated; and supports the OAU as it intensifies its efforts to pursue the cause of reparations.\" The motion was sponsored by Grant, Tony Benn, Tony Banks, John Austin-Walker, Harry Barnes, and Gerry Bermingham; an additional 46 Labour Party MPs signed to support the motion, including Jeremy Corbyn.[13] ARM UK, in a \"Birmingham Declaration\" of 1 January 1994,[14] called upon:\n\nall people of Afrikan origin in the Caribbean, Afrika, Europe, the Americas and elsewhere to support the movement for reparations and join forces with a view to forming a strong united front capable of exposing, confronting and overcoming the psychological, economic and cultural harm inflicted upon us by peoples of European origin.\n\nGrant's approach to reparations included demands for the return of looted African cultural heritage (such as the Benin Bronzes) and that the British government should financially support those who wanted to return to their country of origin.[15][16]\n\n"

            "Personal life and death\n\nBernard Alexander Montgomery Grant, known as Bernie Grant, was a pioneering British politician renowned for his advocacy for racial equality and social justice. Born on February 17, 1944, in Georgetown, British Guiana (now Guyana), he was the second of five children to parents Eric and Lily Grant, both esteemed schoolteachers. His father served as a headmaster and later as principal of a Teachers' Training College, while his mother was a highly respected teacher both in Guyana and later in Haringey, North London. ​\n\nGrant received a classical English education at St. Stanislaus College, a Jesuit boys' secondary school in Georgetown. In 1963, he relocated to the United Kingdom, where he attended Tottenham Technical College and later pursued studies in Mining Engineering at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, though he did not complete his degree. ​\nBritannica Kids\n\nGrant's political career began in local government; he was elected as a Labour councillor in the London Borough of Haringey in 1978. In 1985, he made history by becoming the first Black leader of a local authority in Europe when he assumed leadership of Haringey Council. His tenure was marked by his commitment to anti-racism and social justice initiatives. ​\nberniegrantarchive.org.uk\n\n\nIn 1987, Grant was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Tottenham, becoming one of the first Black MPs in the UK Parliament, alongside Diane Abbott and Paul Boateng. During his time in Parliament, he was known for his outspoken stance on racial and social issues, often challenging the status quo to advocate for marginalized communities. ​\n\nTo preserve his legacy and contributions, the Bernie Grant Trust was established. In partnership with the Heritage Lottery Fund and Middlesex University, the Trust appointed a professional archivist to catalogue and maintain a permanent collection of his papers, books, magazines, memorabilia, correspondence, and photographs. This collection was initially housed at Middlesex University and later transferred to the Bishopsgate Institute in London. ​\n\nGrant's affiliation with Middlesex University extended beyond the archiving of his works. The university collaborated with the Bernie Grant Trust to ensure that his legacy would be accessible for educational and research purposes, reflecting his dedication to education and community engagement. ​\n\nBernie Grant's life and career remain emblematic of the struggle for racial equality and social justice in the UK, and his contributions continue to inspire future generations.\n\nGrant's personal life included three marriages. His third wife, Sharon Grant, was active in public service and was shortlisted to succeed him as the Labour candidate for Tottenham after his death, although she was not selected. Information about his children is limited in public records.​\n\nGrant married three times, His third wife is Sharon Grant. He was living with his third wife in Muswell Hill. He was diabetic since his thirties.[1] He died from a heart attack at Middlesex Hospital on 8 April 2000, aged 56. His funeral procession on 18 April passed through Tottenham towards a service at Alexandra Palace, pausing as it passed the Broadwater Farm estate. According to The Guardian's report, \"An estimated 3,000 people... turned out to salute the black radical. There were dancers and singers, a Highland piper and African drums. Also present were Home Secretary, Jack Straw, Chris Smith, Culture Secretary, Clare Short, Minister for International Development, and Paul Boateng and Keith Vaz, Britain's most senior BAME ministers.\"[17]\n\n\n\n\n"

            "Political career\nIn the mid-1960s, he was, for a period, a member of the Socialist Labour League, led by Gerry Healy. This later became known as the Workers Revolutionary Party. He quickly became a trade union official, and moved into politics, becoming a Labour councillor in the London Borough of Haringey in 1978.\n\nWhen the Conservative government introduced \"rate capping\", Grant led the rate-capping rebellion in the borough in 1984.[3] This created division in the local Constituency Labour Party, but through this split, Grant became the Borough of Haringey leader in 1985.\n\nGrant was associated with the Socialist Campaign Group, and spoke out against police racism.[4]\n\nAs council leader during the 1985 Broadwater Farm riot, in which policeman PC Keith Blakelock was murdered, Grant was brought to national attention when he gave a speech outside Tottenham Town Hall, in which he was widely misquoted as saying \"The police were to blame for what happened on Sunday night and what they got was a bloody good hiding\"[5][1][6] – his actual words were \"the youth think they gave the police a bloody good hiding\".[7][8] His comments brought swift denunciation from the Labour Party leadership, and the then Conservative Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd, called him \"the high priest of conflict\"; several British newspapers also dubbed him \"Barmy Bernie\". Grant claimed that he was merely explaining to a wider audience what the feeling on the estate was like. He claimed his words had been taken out of context, but offered an apology to the family of PC Blakelock.[citation needed] There is conflicting information over whether Grant condemned the violence of the rioters the following day.[9][3][10] To some, Grant was an extremist, yet he supported the prosecution of 45 people subsequently charged with riot and affray.[11]\n\nThe controversy did not prevent him from being elected as MP for Tottenham at the 1987 general election, one of the UK's first Black British MPs since the Liberal Peter McLagan in the 19th century, all of them members of the Labour Party Black Sections movement, being elected at the same time as Diane Abbott and Paul Boateng, as well as Britain's first British Asian MP since the 1920s, Keith Vaz. Grant later stood for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party, but was unsuccessful.\n\nIn 1989, he established and chaired the Parliamentary Black Caucus, modelled after the Congressional Black Caucus of the United States. The organisation was committed to advancing the opportunities of Britain's ethnic minority communities.[12]\n\n"

            "BERNIE\nGRANT\nTRUST\nA Short Biography of\nBernie Grant MP\n-\n1944 – 2000",
            "Early Years\nBernard Alexander Montgomery Grant was born on 17th February\n1944 in Georgetown, British Guiana, now Guyana, the son of two\nschoolteachers, who named him after two generals who were then\nfighting the Second World War.\nHis father, Eric, was a headmaster and, later, principal of a Teachers'\nTraining College. His mother, Lily, was a highly respected teacher, both\nin Guyana and in Haringey, North London. His uncle, Basil Blair, was a\nPresident of the Guyana Trades Union Congress.\nBernie was one of five children and spent three years at his father's\nprimary school in Ituni, one of the bauxite-mining districts of Guyana.\nLater, aged 9, he attended Sacred Heart Roman Catholic School, in\nGeorgetown, winning a scholarship to St. Stanislaus College, a Jesuit\nboys' secondary school. Growing up in a highly diverse community he\nhad friends from many races and religions, both rich and poor.\nAlthough he passed his O Levels with flying colours, Bernie left school\na year later because he wasn't allowed to study his preferred subjects.\nHe then worked for two years as a laboratory analyst before he left for\nEngland to join his family in 1963.\nOn arriving in England Bernie attended Tottenham Technical College\nbefore going on to study engineering at Heriot-Watt University,\nScotland. He left University in 1969 in protest against discrimination\nagainst black students. For the next 9 years, he became an International\nTelephonist, quickly becoming a leading activist in the Union of Post\nOffice Workers, fighting for the rights of fellow workers. He was one of\nthe organisers of the Post Office strike in 1970, and afterwards became\na highly effective Chair of his branch for some years. On leaving he was\nmade an honorary life member of the UPW.\n2",
            "In 1978 he became a full time Area Officer for National Union of\nPublic Employees, NUPE (now UNISON), representing local authority\nand health workers. Finding racism endemic within the trades union\nmovement itself, Bernie then founded the Black Trades Unionists\nSolidarity Movement, and worked for it full time between 1981 and 1984.\nCouncil Leader\nBernie joined the Tottenham Labour Party in 1973, and held numerous\npositions within the local party before being elected a Councillor in 1978.\nHe attracted support in the community for his campaigns against racism\nin education, in policing, as well as within the Council's own services\nand employment practices. His impact was immediate, and within a year\nhe was Deputy Leader of the Council.\nBy 1985 he had become the Leader of Haringey Council, the first ever\nblack person to hold such a position in Europe. As leader he pioneered\na number of equalities policies to eradicate all forms of discrimination.\nDuring this time Haringey Council was one of the few local authorities to\ndevelop policies allowing greater access for the disabled, tackle gender\nand racial discrimination as well as tackling discrimination on the basis\nof sexual orientation. Under the premiership of Margaret Thatcher,\nwho sought to constrain local government, these were seen as highly\ncontroversial at the time. Bernie attracted intense and often racially\ntainted criticism in the press and media, but considerable support from\nlocal people.\nIn the same year he won the nomination for the Tottenham\nParliamentary seat by ousting the sitting MP, the former Labour Party\ntreasurer, Norman Atkinson, with the support of a local black section\nand other activists.\na short biography of Bernie Grant MP 3",
            "The disturbances on Broadwater Farm Estate in 1985, brought him\nto national prominence, as he defended the youth against police\nharassment. Despite meeting the full force of the racism of the British\npress he refused to compromise. Though already selected for the\nTottenham seat, his stance made the Labour Party establishment\nextremely nervous, and the then leadership came under pressure to\nremove him. It was said that his survival as a candidate was due to the\nrespect and affection in which he was widely held, at a time when the\nLabour Party was realising the importance of the black vote in marginal\nconstituencies.\nElected to Parliament\nAfter the 1987 General Election, he was one of the first three Black\nMPs in the Commons, with Diane Abbott and Paul Boateng, alongside\nAsian MP Keith Vaz. He made his mark almost immediately by wearing\ntraditional West African ceremonial dress at the State Opening of\nParliament, wanting to signal the change he intended to represent, as\nwell his pride in his ancestry. This shocked some, but delighted others.\nAs a working MP he quickly maintained his reputation as a firebrand,\nbacking demands for black sections in the Labour Party, urging\nrebellion against the poll tax, and defying convention by disrupting the\nChancellor's Budget speech in 1988, shouting \"shame, shame”.\nSometimes seen as an embarrassment by his party leaders, he criticised\nhis Party on the floor of the House, when it overlooked all black applicants\nfor the Vauxhall by-election in 1989 and fielded a white candidate. The\nconstituency included Brixton, with a high black population.\nIn 1990 he accompanied Rev. Jesse Jackson to South Africa, greeting\nNelson Mandela on the day of his release. Later he established an\ninformation technology centre amid the townships in the Free State,\nwhich was named after him.\n4",
            "Bernie Grant almost trebled his majority in the 1992 General Election,\nand stood for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party, backed by the\nleft wing Campaign group.\nIn 1993, after years of being labelled anti-police, he helped to defuse\na potentially explosive situation following the death of Jamaican\nimmigrant Joy Gardener, while police were trying to arrest her\nfor deportation.\nHe was Chair of the All Party Group on Race and Community, and of\nthe British Caribbean Group. He founded the Standing Conference\non Racism in Europe in 1990, and established the Africa Reparations\nMovement in Britain. In 1995, he founded the Global Trade Centre,\nintending to promote direct and ethical business between African\nand Caribbean countries and black business in Britain. Returned to\nParliament again 1997, he was appointed to the Select Committee on\nInternational Development, and he was the only MP amongst those\nappointed to the Home Secretary's Race Relations Forum in 1998.\nBernie Grant made it a priority to reach black communities throughout\nthe Britain, often conducting exhausting speaking tours, with his distinct\nstyle of oration. He brought their concerns to the floor of the House of\nCommons, where he was outspoken in the cause of eliminating racism\nboth in Britain and the world. He campaigned against discriminatory\npolicing methods and unfair immigration control, about deaths in\ncustody, institutionalised racism in health, housing and education, for\nrefugees' rights, and for greater resources for inner city areas.\nToday his many speeches and parliamentary interventions can be found\nusing the Hansard website or by visiting https://tinyurl.com/y8kbwllm\na short biography of Bernie Grant MP 5",
            "Internationally he fought for the elimination of overseas debt for poor\nnations, and for the recognition of the past injustices of colonisation\nand enslavement. He travelled extensively overseas, making numerous\ninternational contacts, especially with African and Caribbean countries.\nAlthough never with any formal responsibilities, he became an\nimportant back channel though which those countries could make\nthemselves heard in Whitehall. Likewise he was often consulted by\nMinisters on matters affecting them. In 1993 he was awarded an\nhonorary doctorate by Pace University, New York.\nContrary to popular belief, however, he fought not only for racial justice,\nbut for oppressed people whoever they were. Many thousands valued\nhim for the individual attention he gave to their personal difficulties,\nwith his legendary constituency surgeries in Tottenham regularly\nattracting large numbers of people.\nBernie Grant took the concerns of his community to the highest levels of\nGovernment, and was widely regarded as an authentic voice of Britain's\nethnic minorities. In one of his last Parliamentary interventions, then\nsuffering from ill- health, to a hushed Chamber, he famously demanded\nan apology for Britain's role in slavery and colonisation, from the\nPrime Minister.\nBy the time of his death, the outspoken activist of the seventies and\neighties, was seen as a statesman of great integrity. He enjoyed huge\naffection in the black community and beyond. His funeral at London's\nAlexandra Palace in April 2000, attended by leading politicians together\nwith many thousands of people from all sectors of society, confirmed his\nstanding and impact on public life.\n6",
            "A Continuing Legacy\nA dedicated constituency MP, his last battle was to build a major arts\nand cultural facility in his Tottenham constituency. The multi-million\nproject was taken forward after his death, and the Bernie Grant Arts\nCentre, designed by Sir David Adjaye, was opened in 2007 on a site he\nhad identified.\nA posthumous Honorary Doctorate was bestowed on him by Middlesex\nUniversity in 2001.\nIn December 2017, 30 years since his election to Parliament, his portrait,\nby Kelvin Okafor, was commissioned by the Speaker's Arts Fund and\nnow hangs in the House of Commons.\nFor many however, his most important legacy is that the demands he\nmade for equality and social justice, for which he was once so vilified,\nare now embraced as an aspiration across the political spectrum. They\ncontinue to be progressed too by the many young people who worked\nwith him and have since become influential in their own right.\nThe Bernie Grant Trust was established in 2000, and in 2004, with the\nsupport of the Heritage Lottery Fund, it opened an archive of his papers,\nphotographs, audio-visual material and other items. This is well used,\nand held at the Bishopsgate Institute. It continues to be added to, and\nwelcomes additional relevant material.\nOur current priorities are to take the archive on line, and to use Bernie's\nlife and times to encourage a new generation to engage in civic life, by\ndeveloping educational material and other projects, as well as encouraging\nacademic study. It also holds a Memorial Lecture bi-annually.\nFor further information see back page.\na short biography of Bernie Grant MP 7",

            "THE BROADWATER FARM DISTURBANCES AND THE PRESS\nby Dorothy Kinya\na report\n1. I monitored twenty five newspapers, seventeen of them were\nnational papers, five were local, one was a London wide paper.\nOf these four are minority ethnic papers and five are Sunday\npapers. The dates cover are October the 7th, 8th, 9th, to the\n31st 1985 and November 1985 to May 1986. The newspapers we\nmonitored were as follows: the local papers were the Haringey\nAdvertiser, The Haringey Independent, The Weekly Herald, The\nYorkshire Post, The Wolverhampton Express and Star. The London\nwide paper was the London Standard. The minority ethnic papers\nwere New Life, Asian Times, Caribbean Times and The Voice. The\nnational papers were the Daily Mail, The Morning Star, The Sun,\nThe Express, The Mirror, The Daily Telegraph, Financial Times,\nThe Guardian, The Times. The Sunday papers were The Sunday\nMirror, The Observer, The Sunday Times, The Mail on Sunday, The\nSunday Express and the Star.\n2.\nIn 1975 the National Union of Journalists layed down its\nfirst set of guide lines for journalists. Two of these were:-\nOnly mention someones race or nationality if strictly\nrelevant.\nResist the temptation to sensationalise issues which would\nharm race relations.",
            "These were added to in 1977 when the National Union of\nJournalists and the National Graphical Association joint\nagreement stated that:-\nFreedom must be conditioned by responsibility and\nacknowledgement by all media workers of the need not to\nallow press freedom to be abused, to slander a section of\nthe community or to promote the evil of racism.\nThe NUJ and NGA recognised the right of their members to\nwithhold their labour on grounds of concscience because\nemployers are providing a platform for racist propaganda.\nIn reading through the mass of cuttings made available to us we\nhave found very little regard being given to the NUJ guidelines\nmentioned above or the agreement between the NUJ and the NGA. In\nfact the newspapers we have read have gone out of their way to\nmention not only colour but place of origin of many people\ninvolved in the Broadwater Farm disturbances particularly those\npeople who were black and in particular those who do not appear\nto be approved of by the press. For example: \"Jamaican born\nReverend Egland Graham\" vet the mention of two other Reverends\nthe Reverend John Wheaton and the Reverend Francis Ackroyd are\ndone without any reference to colour or ethnicity. The place of\norigin of Bernie Grant and Dolly Kiffen were emphasised in the\nmany articles and reports that were published. Miss Cynthia\nJarrett was described variously as black, or West Indian, or\ncoloured. PC Keith Blakelock's colour or ethnicity is not\nmentioned at all throughout any of the reports.\nThe press",
            "sensationalised the issues related to the disturbances on\nBroadwater Farm through lurid headlines, hysterical and emotional\nreporting, racist and sexist language, which was reinforced by\npictures and cartoons likely to inflame or create anger or fear\nin their readers. We have heard of no journalist withholding\ntheir labour on the grounds of conscience because of the nature\nof the reporting of the events in connection with the Broadwater\nFarm Estate. Neither have we heard of any complaints against\njournalists because of the reporting.\nWe know of no one who has\nbeen disciplined by the NUJ or the NGA for the mass of\ninformation, much of it distorted and inaccurate,\nwhich has been\npublished. It does not appear that the NUJ or the NGA have\nsought to uphold their guidelines or agreements by taking action\nagainst any of their members for their presentation of any of the\nevents of October 6th and 7th 1985. It does appear that the\nguidelines and the agreement are not worth the paper on which\nthere are written.\n3. The racism which is part and parcel of the British way of\nlife has been aptly demonstrated in the press through Eurocentric\nwriting and is addressed to those who share the cultural\nassumptions of the writers of the reports and articles which have\nappeared. Stereotypes are being created and recreated and\nreaffirmed.\nBernie Grant has become the Idi Amin of the 80's-\nall the more frightening for being on our doorstep and not\nsomeone who can be easily deported. In fact a delegate at the\nAnnual Conservative Party Conference at that time demanded tht he\nbe deported. He is now the 'Barmy Bernie who must be disowned'\n'who is evil' 'who is defiant' who is even,\namazingly, classed",
            "as a 'racist'.\nThe new bogeys are the English born Black Youth\nwho are here to stay because their parents and sometimes they\ngrandparents have been here for many, many years, and cannot be\nexiled or wished away. They have been characterised as\n'muggers,' 'rapists' 'lazy' drug pedlars' or 'drug takers' and\nworst of all 'murderers'. Stereotypes become a reality which\nmeans to the that Black people and either ostracised,\nrejected\nor harassed and are put away either in prison or in mental\ninstitutions. The press was not only racist in its presentation\nof the events of that sad and tragic period, but also extremely\noffensive in its attempts to be witty at the expense of women on\nthe Farm. One reporter Amrit Roy describing Broadwater Farm\n-\n'as a no-go area' said: 'Here the housewife cannot\nhave an\naffair with the milkman, even if she felt so inclined. The\nmilkman stopped calling a year ago. That appeared in the Daily\nMail. However the Mirror on the same day shows a picture of the\nso-called disappeared milkman Michael Edwards delivering his milk\non the day that the Mail report was filed.\nMISS CYNTHIA JARRETT AND PC KEITH BLAKELOCK AND THE PRESS\n4.\n\"British relations with non-whites in all parts of the world\nhave been characterized by white domination so that colour\nhas become, on average, a factually accurate index relative",
            "wealth, power and status. The ideas and imagery surrounding\nwhite domination have served to legitimate the assumption\nthat colour confers a differential entitlement to status and\nresources.'\n11\nIt is instructive to compare the way the press handled the news\nof the death of Mrs Cynthia Jarrett and of PC Keith Blakelock.\n5. The death of PC Blakelock was given continual front page.\nheadline coverage in almost all th papers, \"London riots kill a\nPC\" \"PC murdered in riot fury\" \"Rioters kill policeman\", \"KILL,\nKILL, KILL,\" \"Police officer knifed to death\", \"Hacked to death\",\n\"Red butchers\", \"Name the killers,\"\n\"Name the killers,\" and then a sub heading: \"150\npounced to slice him up\". In most of the papers of the 7th and\n8th October placed his death was placed ahead of Cynthia\nJarrett's in the story line. Her death was either mentioned in a\nvery few words, - fourteen words in one case, thirty words in\nanother, or the police version was given before the family's.\nOnly four papers headlined Mrs Jarrett's death, for example as\nfollows: \"Police left woman who died on the hallway floor\",\n\"Tottenham riot after black women's death\", \"Mother dies in\npolice raid\", \"One mother is like all our mothers\". One\nnewspaper headlined the death of the policeman and wrote 180\nwords on him and 25 on Mrs Jarrett, when Mrs Jarrett was\nmentioned in the same item as PC Blakelock, it was always much\nfurther down the page or in another column towards the end of the\nreport in the article. There were three articles in one paper on\nthe issues related to the disturbances, each of them mentioned PC\nBlakelock but made no mention at all of Mrs Jarrett.\n-",
            "6.\nMrs Blakelock, the widow of the murdered policeman, was\nquoted on numerous occasions, her expression of sympathy for the\nrioters, her compassion for people who were caught up in that\nsituation. Police colleagues of her husband, were interviewed\nextensively. There was coverage of her family life and also of\nthe professional life of PC Blakelock as well as his personal\nlife. Many of his colleagues gave testimony about him as\npoliceman and people in the community were also interviewed.\nnewspaper carried details of his childhood with photographs of\nhim as a child. Photographs of him which did appear showed him in\ncivilian clothing same very large and on the front page. None of\nthem showed him in uniform. In the publicity surrounding his\ndeath following October 6th, there were extensive calls to punish\nhis murderers and to find his murderers.\nOne\n7. The contrary applies to Mrs Cynthia Jarrett. Only three\npapers attempted to cover get the story of her death in some\ndetail with have quotes from her family and the family's lawyer.\nNo newspaper had bothered to deal with her life, with her as a\nperson, no reporters have asked for comments by her friends, her\nfamily, about the sort of person she was, why she came to this\ncountry all the sort of things that create an empathy with a\nperson. Nowhere is her country of origin mentioned, she was just\n-\ndescribed as 'coloured',\n'coloured',\n'black'\n'black', 'West Indian'. One newpaper\ndescribed her as 'a 20 stone West Indian divorcee\n1\nwho\napparently died from heart failure'. One newpaper after\ndescribing PC Blakelock as 'being brutally stabbed' went on to\nsay 'that Mrs Cynthia Jarrett died of a heart attack.\nShe was\ngrossly over weight and had other medical problems.\n-\neven so",
            "1\nleaders of the West Indian community talk of her being killed.\nThe only comments which would extend the reader's knowledge and\ndraw on their sympathy for Mrs Jarrett were the incidental\ncomments made by Dolly Kiffin, Bernie Grant and another black\nwoman who lived on Broadwater Farm and each of them commented on\nthe fact that she was well known and she was well liked. On\nOctober 8th there was less coverage of Mrs Jarrett but increasing\ncoverage of PC Blakelock and his murder and lots of information\nabout his family and his colleagues. One national newspaper set\nup an appeal fund for PC Blakelock starting it with a £5,000\ndonation from the newspaper, incidentally the London Fire Brigade\nhas set up a fund also for the Blakelock family.\n8.\nBy October 9th Mrs Jarrett death had almost disappeared from\nthe press except for mention of the inquest. Reference was\ncontinually being made to PC Blakelock and as details began to\nemerge on how he died. From reports of the inquest Mrs.\nJarrett's death was described in terse medical terms by the\npress, however the account of PC Blakelocks death was given\nadditional sensational coverage by additional descriptions of\nother policemen 'I have seen the body and you couldn't count the\nwounds. He was slashed to pieces'.\n9. There were no longer any photographs of Mrs Jarrett appearing\nin the papers but the one picture of PC Blakelock in civilian\nclothes continued to be shown and he continued to be described as\n'a victim'. Continual calls were made through the press for\ntougher action by the Home Secretary, and Sir Kenneth Newman\nagainst rioters, and to find the killers of PC Blakelock.\nAt no",
            "time was a call made for the police to deal with the policemen\ninvolved in entering the house of the Jarrett family and pushing\nover Mrs Jarrett. No one called for suspensions, disciplining or\nquestioning. A few papers mentioned the formal inquiry into Mrs.\nJarrett's death and appeared content with that. Reports on the\nfollowing days, weeks, months, set out to justify police action\nand villify people, black people on Broadwater Farm specifically,\nparticularly those who were leading personalties on the farm.\n-\n-\na\n10. Sir Kenneth Newman is reported as saying 'PC Blakelock\nhusband and a father of three children as well as a invaluable\nhome beat officer\nwas savagely murdered in a knife attack', he\nwent on to add as if it were an after thought 'his loss is every\nbit as sad as the death of Mrs Jarrett and added to the sadness\nis an undeniable anger at the unambiguous viciousness of his\nkilling'.\nOne would say that the same thoughtful comments could\nhave been made about Mrs Jarrett and her five children's loss of\na mother. What we see in the press is a marginalisation of the\ndeath of Mrs Jarrett, in most of the reports there's been an\nattempt to suggest that she might be responsible for her own\ndeath after all she was overweight, she already had certain\nmedical conditions. Suggestions in some newspaper accounts of\nthe incident surrounding her death was that it was her son coming\ninto the house and having an altercation with the police that led\nto her collapse in other words the media is helping British\nsociety to wash its hands of the death of Mrs Jarrett and to not\ntake any responsibility for it whatsoever.

The opening sentence of the\narticle \"They were not out to loot, the Tottenham rioters were\nout to kill\". The article went on to give a count down from 7.15\np.m on the 6th October to 11.30 p.m, from a police view point. A\neditoral in the Daily Mail headed \"The choice for Britain's\nblacks\" and the choice, as pointed out by that paper, was \"Either\nthey obey the loyalty of this land where they have taken up\nresidence and accepted both the full rights and responsibilities\nof citizenship, or they must expect the facist street agitators.\nto call evermore boldly for them to go back from whence they\ncame.\" Mr Harvey Proctor MP for Billericey and chairman of the\nMonday club's Immigrants Committee, made his call \"for a policy\nof resettlement of immigrants in advance of the Conservative\nConference\" which was about to commence the following week he\nalso called \"for the existing repatriation scheme under the 1971\nimmigrantion act to be supplemented by a resettlement grant of\n£4,000 to £4000 or whatever figure would needed to be to upset\nthe growth of the new commonwealth population.\"",
            "13.\nOnly four newspapers The Finincial Times, The Daily\nTelegraph, The Morning Star and The Guardian, headlined Sir\nKenneth Newman's statement on plastic bullets and there were\nvarious headlines accompanying that. The Morning Star also\nheadlined \"Police left women who died lying on her hallway floor\"\nand reported the London Borough of Haringey's press conference in\nsome detail. In their report \"police plastice bullets threat\"\nthey quoted Labour Party spokesman. The Daily Telegraph reported\nextensively Sir Kenneth Newman statement and the Home Secretary's\ncomments.\n14. The variety of headlines and page leads in the Sun on the\n8th of October were quite illustrative the major headline was\n\"Lazy yobs just live off crime\", \"its Barmy Bernie on the\nattack\", \"Two son accused\" these refers to the sons of Mrs.\nJarrett who were appearing in court. Another headline was \"bomb\ncharge\" and relates to a student who was granted £2,000 pounds.\nbail.

That particular addition of The Sun also\nappealed for the setting up of a fund for PC Blakelock with a\nby-line 'coppers for a copper'.\n15. On the 9th October the papers were well into their stride,\nthe headlines were more varied and the papers were finding their\nown special angle. The Daily Mail had its headline 'white\nvictims of racial humbug this is a vicious article and full of\ncant. It expresses pity for \"white and asian people living on\nhousing estate monopolised by black youth\" \"leading a life of\nwretchedness and persecution\". It talks of young white mothers\nbeing afraid to shop even in daylight and described how \"white\nmen on shift work run from their cars to front doors so\nfrequently kicked in that steel frames have had to be erected\naround the timber and the locks\". They then go on to say \"on\nBroadwater Farm estate there are a few trappings of a normal\nmurder inquiry. The police are still trying to find murderers\nwho kill their colleague, but they are the ones who are being\ntold not to act in an inflammatory manner\". The impression given\nis that the police cannot come on normal police inquiries because\nof presumably \"Black Youth\". Other variables in headlines are\n\"Riots Tories blast men of hate \"Rioters storm council to axe\n-\npolice cash\".\n16.\nThe headlines begin to be more personalised \"Riot Jibe\nBernie in £45,000 loan row\" this refers to the fact that Bernie.\nGrant's sister is part of a co-operative which has benefitted",
            "from a grant from the council. The report suggests that her\n-\nbrother was involved in securing the grant for the co-operative.\nThe Sunday Mirror becomes even more personal the new slogan is\n\"Barmy Bernie moves in with blond\", the focus is now on rooting\nout Bernie Grant's personal life and that of all his family and\nhis personal friends. Some papers have a hey-day digging the\ndirt. Others however begin to take stock in a more thoughtful\nway. The Observer attempts to seek clarity about Bernie Grant as\na politician is the article headed \"Instinctive activist in the\nTown Hall\". It talks of Bernie Grant's uncompromising approach\nto politics. In The Financial Times, article \"Man in the News\"\nit profiles Bernie Grant under the heading \"Town Hall Boss at the\nBarricades\". For the more thinking journalists Bernie Grant is\n-\n-\nTo the less\nclearly a phenomemon a black person in a powerful position who\nwill not play the white institutions game of adaptation after\nachieving leadership. He refuses to wear the establishment hat\nor to take on establishment patterns of behaviour.\nthinking journalist of which there are many if the news coverage\nwhich we have been monitoring is anything to go by he provides\ngood copy and will probably provide headlines for years to come.\nbecause of his particular brand of honesty and unwillingness to\ncompromise. It is interesting however that since he had been\nreturned to power with a much higher vote than previously and\nwith many of his other colleagues in Haringey the media has said\nvery little about him. They may want to hold back on giving him.\nany more publicity because maybe they've given him so much\npuls\nalready of such a vicay kind that, a backlash of decent Black and\nWhite people has presented Bernie with a greater political\nvictory and vote than he had preciding.\nThe headlines began to",

            "THE PRESS AND THE PICTURES\n1\n18. Press cuttings contained 191 pictures including 6 cartoons\nall of these were related to the disturbances. The photographers\nand editors were clearly fascinated by the scenes of policemen\nlooking like Roman soldiers in their helmets with visors and huge\nshields and small round shields carrying sticks. Of the total\nnumber of pictures, 87 had policemen in them, 36 were just of the\npolice at the scene of the disturbances in riot gear, 18 were of\nPC Blacklock, there were only nine pictures of Mrs Jarrett.\nThere were 13 pictures showing police in hospital, four of these\nwere a repeated picture of a hospitalised policeman with a black\npoliceman. Except or those four pictures it was not possible to\nknow how many black policemen or women there were because of the\npolice being in riot gear. One picture showed a white\ndemonstrator confronting the police outside Tottenham Police\nStation, others showed two policemen arresting a black man, two\nblack men shouting at two policemen and two policemen arresting a\nwhite man. There were a number of pictures showing the police\nassisting white people off the estate during the disturbances,\none of an old woman , with the caption \"Frail and frightened\".\nThe same picture was used in another newspaper with the a\ndifferent caption which read \"Tottenham Burns and a bewildered\n-\nelderly victim is led gently away from the flames of hate\". A\nyoung white man is shown carrying a child and being helped by a\npoliceman. This picture was also shown in two or three papers.\nThe caption for that was \"Young and Innocent\n-\na baby is\nshielded\". There was another picture of a policeman with a",
            "wounded white civilian, the picture of this same white civilian\nwas shown on a stretcher. The caption under the first picture\nsaid \"Hit\n1\na TV sound man and a policeman hit by shot gun\npellets\". There was another of a white woman and a child and the\ncaption was \"a mother and child escorted to safety by a ambulance\nman and police officers in riot gear during last night's\ndisturbances\".\nThere were two different pictures in different\nnewspapers of young white mothers wheeling babies in prams the\nday after the troubles, one of the pictures was captioned \"a\nstunned mum pushes her baby through the debris\". Others with\nwhite people showed them on the 7th October, walking along the\nstreets and around the estate, cleaning the estate. Others\npictures showed one Black person in a demonstration with White\npeople against Bernie Grant. This was part of an article headed\n\"A thousand strikers saying Grant must go\". There were a few\nphotographs of Princess Diana on her visit to the estate some of\nthem with Dolly Kiffin. The rest related to Bernie Grant and\nSharon Lawrence except for the latter the pictures were clearly\npart of an image of white people fleeing from the farm and the\nblack people who lived on it. Then there was the image of the\npoliceman helping poor old white women, young white women,\nand the white wounded. These were clearly to distract readers.\nfrom the more war-like and aggressive image and dress and posture.\nof what The Voice magazine characterised as \"the soldier in\nblue\". It was a bid for sympathy and support as was the\ncontinual harping on the centrality of the death of PC Blakelock\nto the events of the 6th and 7th of October as against the\nimportance of the death of Mrs Jarrett. One picture showed a\ndemonstration in support of Bernie Grant, although I know this\nbabies",
            "was a multi-racial demonstration the picture of it in the\nnewspaper showed it as an all black demonstratio- The caption\nread \"prourant demonstrators from NALGO outside civic centre\nyesterday\".\n19. There were 44 pictures of a black person or black people but\n35 of these were of Bernie Grant on his own. Among the many\ncaptions under the many pictures that appeared of Bernie Grant\nwere \"astonishing attack on police\" \"No condemnation\".\nblasted as evil\".\n\"attack\",\"defiant\"\n\"he was\nSome of the captions were very terse like for\nexample \"attack\", \"defiant\" \"blacklist\" \"under fire\", \"tightrope\",\nand, amazingly, \"a racist\". A number of pictures of Dolly Kiffin\nwere beginning to appear, there was a picture also of her son in\nJamaica and two of young black men, one in a verbal confrontation\nand another is the now well known picture of a young black man in\ndark clothes with white boots carrying a petrol bomb, there was\nno indication where this came from, it was from a previous\ndisturbance not on Broadwater Farm. The caption underneath that\npicture read \"for the hell of it... riotous youth 1985\". Other\npictures showed street scenes on the estate the day following the\ndisturbance, a trolley with missiles, a crate of petrol bombs, a\npicture of the knife which killed PC Blakelock, a number of\npictures of petrol bombs, burning cars and the damaged school,\nshops and the house that was set on fire.\n20. The juxtaposition of the pictures and the placing of the\nappropriate text and headlines together created a vivid,\ndistorted and totally exaggerated picture, calculated to create a\nnegative image of Black people of Broadwater Farm and",
            "particularly of young black people and to present a positive\nimage of the police and White people. The latter if living on or\naround the farm were present as being in fear of their lives. The\nview of Broadwater Farm presented by the press was almost totally\nnegative and very destructive. The headlines reinforced this\nnegative image and added to the fearful message.\n\"A city errupts in fury.\nIts residents are appalled and\noutraged.\n\"Multi-racial committees are appointed and scapegoats appear\nfrom everywhere. Instead of wretched housing and stifling\nunemployment, outside aggitators and wily communists are\nsaid to be the most important causes. Always the basic\nreasons are at best minimised and at worst denied. After\nthree centuries of oppression the black man and woman is\nstill thought to need a provocateur to inflame them.\"\nCONCLUSION\nGENERAL NEWS COVERAGE\n\"Most white people don't want to believe the black people\nare really mad. They don't want to believe that so many\npeople are justly aggrieved against them and their\ninstituations. And at it is much easier to look at Stokely\nCormichael and other alleged outside agitators\".",
            "But talking about outside aggitators...is a way of not\ntaking them seriously, of not giving them their full stature\nas men. And in order to stop the riots Americans are going\nto have to look not only at Stokely Carmichael but at their\nmost cherished institutions they are going to have to\n-\nadmit that black people are rebelling because they are men.\nOne might also add here -women and because they live in a\nsociety which denys that they are men and (women).\"\nBy\nLerone Bennett junior, from an article in Ebony titled 'How\nto stop riots' October 1967.\"\n21.\nThe ethos of the press in its dealing with the BRoadwater\nFarm disturbances is characterised by the ideological trappings\nof the rightness of whiteness, the right to rule, the right to\nsay what it wishes about the people who live on the estate,\nparticularly about those who are black and those who support the\nchanges and developments on the Broadwater Farm estate. Except\nfor the black press and one or two thoughtful items from some\nnational papers reporting of the events of the 6th and 7th\nOctober was totally negative and unconstructive in its\npresentation particularly of the roles of black people. The only\nexception was a headline \"Brave Black constable who saved PCs\nlife\", and this covered a story about a black constable who\nprotected a white colleague when he was injured and lying on the\nground. Otherwise we find that Dolly Kiffin and Bernie Grant in\nparticular and members of Mrs Jarrett's family have been\npresented as being irresponsible, and troublemakers.\nAs a group\nBlack youths have been presented as being out of control and this\nwas marked by one headline \"mobs of mainly black youths\" This",
            "Even\nwas part of a description of the disturbances on the farm.\nthe evidence of the family was put in doubt when printed so that\nin The Daily Telegraph report about the death of Mrs Jarrett the\nevidence of Cynthia Jarrett was presented as \"she claimed that one\nof the policemen pushed her mother and caused her to fall\".\nWhereas a Scotland Yard spokesman in the same item \"was shown to\nhave said Mrs Jarrett was initially very co-operative.\" The\nScotland Yard spokesman's statement is presented as fact where\nthere is some doubt about the statement by Cynthia Jarrett who\nwas actually present at the event. It is unlikely that the\nScotland Yard spokesman was. The comment that we were most\nstruck, which, was by the Jarrett family in relation to the\nincident at their home, they said that the police \"showed no\nrespect for their mother, they ignored her\". This comment is a\nreflection also of what happens in wider society, which is that,\nin general White people have no respect for Black people and as\nfar as possible ignore them. Bernie Grant was wrongly described\nas Haringey's black mayor in The Guardian of the 7th and 10th\n1986. And John Akass in The Express said \"it might well be\nnecessary to say that an evil alliance between Jamaica and the\nterraces of Tottenham united by the light and carefree use of\nviolence is not the kind of multi-racialism to which we ought,\nproperly to aspire.\" The Mail writes \"It isn't England any more.\nNot to the white residents who want to move out. Not to the\nAsian shop-keepers who are moving out\". This reference, of\ncourse is to Broadwater Farm. So, who is left this must be the\nAfrican/Caribbean community, who it is suggested are taking over,",
            "and who, it is further suggested are not capable of taking over\nor being in charge of anything. A further report in The Daily\nMail of the same day was of Barbara who is described as a white\nresident of Broadwater Farm. She is reported as saying \"that the\npolice told her that she could not return to the farm on 6th\nOctober and that they told her if you are white you are dead\".\nThe article goes on to say \"Barbara is used to abuse, 'white\nslag, white bitch', the black youths often shout when she goes.\nshopping\". The Daily Mail has given many graphic accounts of\nlife on Broadwater Farm as has The Mail On Sunday. They\nparticularly detail the rape of a white woman who was seven\nmonths pregnant by four black men. And another white woman\nvictim of mugging and also breaking and entering by a black\nyouth. This was also part of the package that was presented\nabout life on the farm during the period that The Mail was\nreporting the disturbances on the farm. The Black youth one\nsingled out by inference or directly for scurrilous attacks.\nare told in reports that not only do the white population of\nBroadwater Farm leave their homes in trepidation, the old blacks\nconcede that they have lost control of their youths. The Mirror\neditorial headed \"vicious and inevitable\" also attacks black\nyouths and ends with a call \"for the sake of all decent, law\nabiding people\n1\nWe\nthe vast majority of their leaders have got to\ntake control of their own communities. Especially the young\".\nThe article called Mrs Cynthia Jarrett 'Patricia' and clearly\nplaced responsibility for the disturbances at the door of the\nblack community. Only one newspaper attempted to give the youth\na chance to talk for themselves and this was in a short report by\nRizu Hamid in The Guardian of the 8th October 1986. The article",
            "headed \"Youths fear protest will not be heeded\", made some\ninteresting reading.\n\"Its a shame that someone had to die during\nthe protests but I'm telling you its more of a pity that it was a\npoliceman because now they are going to put all the blame on us\nand say that we are criminals\" said one black man early\nyesterday.\n-\n\"They think we just riot for the sake of it, as if we\nlike to see our own areas being burnt up\" said another young man.\nBut we've got a reason. They near enough killed a black woman in\nBrixton, now another innocent woman is dead it wouldn't be so\nbad if it was one of us or someone who was guilty that got\ninjured\". Rizu Hamid also went on to say that one Rastafarian\naccused white journalists of not talking to young blacks.\nIt was\nthe same reporter who quoted an Asian bus driver as saying \"If I\nwas their age and hadn't had a job since I left school and was\ncalled a Paki and a black bastard on top of that by the police, I\nprobably would react in the same way\". This was a particularly\ninteresting comment as the press were suggesting that Asians on\nthe estate were harassed by black youth and that there was no\nsympathy or relationship between Afro/Caribbean people and\nmembers of the Asian community who lived in or around the estate.\nThe press failed to mention, for example that there are a number\nof Asian workers on the estate working full time and who have\ncontinued to work there.\n23. The negative portrayal of relationships between black and\nwhite people on the estate was particularly damaging. The\nimpression gained through all the reports was that there was no\npositive relationship at all. There was no mention of the\nexcellent meal service for the mainly white elderly and other",
            "activities which white people attended at the Broadwater\nFarm Youth Association building and in other places in and around\nthe farm. There was nothing said of how the campaigns to improve\nthe estate which were spearhead by the Tenants Association and\nthe Broadwater Farm Youth Association had created initially a\ngreat deal of work which had mainly benefitted White people. It\nhad meant more White cleaners, caretakers, repair workers, and\nstaff at the Housing Office. The press did not mention either\nthat a great many of the people who are working on the estate in\nthe various services on a day to day basis, some of whom also\nlive there are White and have in their interviews with us, said\nthat in their relationships with Black people are not\nsignificantly different from their relationships with other White\npeople. Nothing was said about the fact that many of the\nfamilies on the farm are inter-racial or are living in\nmulti-racial households single people particularly, male and\nfemale. The press set out to emphasize contrasts and divisions\nand exacerbated these by the way in which they reported them. So\nwe have the picture of \"a Methodist minister the very Reverend\nJohn Wheaton, who sheltered his 50 strong congregation in the\nchurch during the rioting\". Low down the column in the same\narticle \"black vigilantes last night warned the police 'stay away\n-\nor more of you will die'\". In another part of the same paper,\nThe Sun, of 9th October 1986, an unnamed Labour councillor is\nreported to have said \"Bernie Grant is like the leader of a black\ntribe\n-\nalways looking for battles and shaking his spear. He\nsees all Whites as his enemies\". The same paper did not return",
            "for a quote to the unnamed councillor, when it reported about\n\"Barmy Bernie and his new woman\", later in a report on Councillor\nGrant's relationship with Sharon Lawrence a white woman.\n-\n24. That the press treats race relations issues and the presence\nof black and minority ethnic people as a problem, and sees them\ncreating conflict situations has been born out by the research of\nPaul Hartman and Charles Husband in their well researched book\n\"Racism and the Mass Media\". Their research was reaffirmed in\nthe 1981 Commission For Racial Equality report \"Public Awaremess\nand the Media a study of reporting on Race\". It would seem\nthat when disturbances of the kind seen on Broadwater Farm occur,\nit is as if a nightmare has come true, particularly, as in this\ncase the police were unable to agree/take control of what were\npercieved as being Black rioters with a few Whites involved\n(although at no time has a white person been interviewed who\nsupported so called the Black rioters) Since the disturbances\nthe response of the press is for plastic bullets, more police,\nmore arms, more punishment and more legislation for support of\nthe police, particularly to deal with rioters or to expel\nimmigrants. Nowhere was a call made for a more effective race\nrelations act or for less racism or for more equal opportunities.\nthe\n25. The press coverage of the disturbances at Broadwater Farm\nand its follow up reporting, which has been characterised by\nommissions of what has happened to the people on the farm since the\ndisturbances, leaves us in no doubt that most of the press is\nguilty of inciting racial hatred and possibly further racial\nconflict. The divisions between black people and white people",
            "were already created way back in our history \"In spite of the\ndecolonisation, the beliefs and imagery of white superiority are\nstill common currency in Britain and represent a widespread\ntendency to accept the relatively disadvantaged position of black\npeople as natural and even necessary\". These divisions are\nreaffirmed daily in the press, on radio and television, so it not\nsurprising that in a BBC London Plus programme survey in\nOctober, \"Most white people in London think the police are too\nsoft with troublemakers. They want the police to use tear gas\nand plastic bullets.\" On the other hand a quarter of black\npeople supported the riots, and 61% of black people opposed the\nuse of plastic bullets. At the same period a survey of 633 West\nIndians showed that 30% thought that black people had been\nrejected by white people and almost half of them forecast\nworsening race relation. In spite of all this information the\nmass media continues its racist reporting, stereotyping, its\ndistortions and its jingoism. Dudley Trainer's Troyners research\nin \"Public Awareness and The Media\", states \"a large proportion\nof the white majority rely almost exclusively on the media for\ninformation on the size and nature of the black community, and\nfor details of the relations between those communities and there\nwhite counterparts. Indeed even where white people live (and\nwork) in close proximity to blacks, interaction between them may\nbe limited. In these situations the media may once again be\nregarded as an important source of information and interpretation\nabout race relations\".",
            "25.\nBlack organisations, who over the past few years have been\nable to receive for the first time grant aid from central and\nlocal government which enables them to deal with many of their\ncommunity problems are now being held up as irresponsible and\nuntrustworthy, there is talk of \"unscrupulous local leaders\"\nreceiving grants and stirring up racial hatred and riot. the\nsuggestion being that the organisations who receive the money\nallow their leaders to pocket it or to do what they like with it.\nIndividuals, characters have been defamed and the public, having\nno other source of information but the press accepts the\ninformation given by the press about particular people. In one\narticle, Dolly Kiffin was described as \"just an ordinary West\nIndian mother with her own talents but without the intellectual\ncapacity to run a high profile political campaign. They say she\nis being manipulated by the far left.\" So we are faced with\nanother stereotype and that is of the black person who is not\nreally as clever and as able as they seem to be. If a black\nperson shows the immense ability, commitment and toughness that\nsomeone like Dolly Kiffin has done then there must be someone\nmanupulating her because afterall according to the stereotype\nblack people do not have such ability, they are not trustworthy,\nthey are not honest and they haven't got a very able intellectual\ncapacity.\n26. The image of the black person in the mass media and even in\nchildrens literature as remained almost static, there have been\nsome slight changes in the stereotype but certain classic\nelements continue and are reiterated.\nIn fact very little has\nchanged since 1735 when Linnaeaus in his book about the diversity",
            "of mankind divided homo-sapiens into five groups. The African\nwas on the lowest rung of the ladder of that grouping and was\ndescribed by him as \"black, phlegmatic, relaxed.\nHair black,\nfrizzled, skin silky, nose flat, lips tumid. Crafty, indolent,\nnegligent.\nAnnoints himself with grease. Governed by caprice\".\n27. We often forget how long we have had a public press and\naround the same time that Linnaeaus and many others were writing\non the diverse races of mankind the press was getting under way\nand negative reporting of black people was also part and parcel\nof the general day to day reporting so it has a long history.\n-\nFor example, in complaining of the number of negro servants\ncoming into Britain, the Gentlemen's magazine of 1764 said \"The\nmain objections to their importation is, that they cease to\nconsider themselves as slaves in this free country, nor will they\nput up with an inequality of treatment, nor more willingly\nperform the laborious offices of servitude than our own people.\nIf put to it they are generally sullen, spiteful, treacherous and\nrevengeful. And the Morning Post of December 1786 another\nnewspaper of the period, reports how an MP \"intends to bring in a\nbill to prevent blacks from being brought into the kingdom.\nThere is such a law in France and a very excellent one it is.\nWhen so many of our young men and women are out of employment,\nand, literally speaking, are starving in the streets, it is\nabominable that aliens, and more particularly black aliens,\nshould be suffered to eat the bread of idleness in Gentle\nhouses\". We have to say sadly that nothing appears to have\nchanged.",
            "f\n28.\nThe press has shown a lack of integrity and responsibility\nin its coverage of the events relating to Broadwater Farm on\nOctober 6th and 7th. Our report will show in detail much of what\nwas happening during and since the disturbances and this is\ninformation which the press could have obtained quite easily if\nit had bothered to make the effort to do so. In fact when the\npress chooses to campaign on social issues and carry out major\ninvestigations into areas of social concern it is second to none\nin its ability to ferret out information and to bring about\nchange. We remain confident that the press can play an active\npositive and critical role in improving race relations and\ncommunity relations and we would not wish to take away from it\nthe right to and the freedom to express itself about areas of\nconcern. We believe it should do so with responsibility and with\nregard to the major influence it had for change for better or for\nworse. We would ask the press that it looks to its very\nsubstantial powers to change the face of racism and social\ndeprivation in this country. To be concerned only with news.\nvalue and therefore popular sales, suggests that the press are\nconcerned only about profit and not people. We are concerned not\nonly with the adults of today but with the adults of tomorrow.\nWe have heard horrific stories of black childrens fears of\npolicemen, since their homes have been raided by the police.\nOf childrens fears of bombfires and fireworks since the night of\nthe 6th and the 7th October. We fear for those children and for\nthe many others that are at a very young age read parts of the\npress, watch television, and listen to radio. There has been\nmajor research done which shows \"when characters belonging to\nminority groups are presented in a favourable light the attitudes",
            "of readers moved in a positive direction, however when characters\nbelonging to minority groups were presented in an unfavourable.\nlight attitudes of readers moved in a negative direction...\nThe\nresearch shows, the more attractive and desirable the models, the\ngreater the likelihood that the reader will be able to identify\nwith them personally and therefore feel positively towards those\ncharacters\". All children are being presented with negative\nimages of black people through the press, and those images teach\na black child to undervalue itself and to be ashamed. The same\nimages teach a white child the superior values of whiteness and\nthe negative values of blackness. Sara Goodman Zimet in her book\n\"Print and Prejudice\" says \"Through the mass media, journalists,\npoliticians, marketing specialists and propaganda purveyors have\nsuccessfully exploited the power of words to move adults to buy\nproducts and ideas\". We believe that the ordinary white British\nperson would buy the idea of racial justice and of equal\nopportunities if they are properly explained and not negatively\nsensationalized.\n29. We would recommend that the NUJ guidlines and the NUJ/NGA\nagreement be rigorously enforced and be a disciplinary matter in\nthose unions. The Press Council also needs to take a firmer line\non how press deal with issues and how Black and Minority ethnic\npeople and women are treated in the press. The unions and the\nPress Council should be monitoring press coverage of sensitive\nissues or major public disturbances, And journalists themselves\nshould be monitoring their own work and their own attitudes.\nDorothy Kuna."

            "BERNIE GRANT\nTRUST\nThe Bernie Grant Memorial Lecture 2015\n10th September 2015\nBy Gary Younge\nIn the film The Matrix, Morpheus (played by Laurence Fishburne) offers Neo\n(Keanu Reeves) a stark choice. He can either gain a greater understanding of\nthe complex forces that comprise the world in which he lives; or he can\ncontinue in a state of imperilled ignorance as though they do not exist. \"You\ntake the blue pill and the story ends,\" promises Morpheus. \"You wake in your\nbed and you believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill and\nyou stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.\"\nGenerally speaking America prefers the blue pill. Most wealthy western\ncountries do. In America's case it starts with the founding myth that the nation\nwas found, not on genocide and slavery, but freedom and democracy. And\nsince then there has been the unrelenting pursuit of progress. Sure there\nhave been bumps in the road. The few hundred years of slavery, the decades\nof Jim Crow, the internment of the Japanese, McCarthyism. Some bumps\nwere bigger than others but the general understanding has been that they\nwere rumbling on the right direction.\nWhen I first went there in 2003 I bought a school history text book, America's\nPromise, so I could know what they all know. I know England's myths. I was\nraised with them. I've seen the way it eases itself into its murky history like an",
            "BERNIE GRANT\nTRUST\nold man into a cold bath. I know what you have to remember and, more\nimportantly, what you have to forget, if you want to put the Great in Great\nBritain. I know that power has many parents but that the brutality it takes to\nacquire it is an orphan. That's why so much of black history month takes\nplace in the passive voice. India was colonised; Rosa Parks was kicked off\nthe bus; People were denied service at the lunch counter. Things were done\nbut nobody did them. There was racism - nobody denies that - but\napparently no racists.\nAnyway, the final chapter of America's Promise ends with this rallying cry.\n\"The history of the United States is one of challenges faced, problems\nresolved, and crises overcome. Throughout their history Americans have\nremained an optimistic people, carrying this optimism into the new century.\nThe full promise of America has yet to be realised. This is the real promise of\nAmerica; the ability to dream of a better world to come.\"\nSuch are the assumptions beamed from the torch of Lady Liberty, coursing\nthrough the veins of the nation's political culture and imbibed with mothers'\nmilk. America, many will tell you, is not just a land mass but an ideal - a\nshining city on the hill beckoning a bright new tomorrow and a dazzling dawn\nfor all those who want it badly enough. Almost everyone, across races and\nethnicities, buys into that to some degree.\nTake the blue pill and the story of the last few years that has brought the\nBlack Lives Matter movement into existence can be interpreted any range of\nways: the necessary slaying of unruly street thugs by honourable police\nofficers; a series of incidents in which young people and rattled officers have\nproduced unfortunate but inevitable outcomes. Or even outrageous examples\nof individual police exercising unnecessary and unlawful force on minority",
            "BERNIE GRANT\nTRUST\ncommunities. All these conclusions would qualify for the blue pill simple\nreason that in their various ways they would understand them as one-offs.\nThey suggest the shootings were possibly flawed responses, but essentially\nisolated incidents the significance of which does not spread beyond their own\nborders. Glitches in the matrix, but not a challenge to the matrix itself.\nBut take the red pill and you are forced to recognise that there can only be so\nmany isolated incidents before we must establish a pattern and that the\nnature of that pattern will not only shape our understanding of those incidents\nbut frame our ideas about how a society operates.\n'The way we see things is affected by what we know and what we believe,\"\nwrote John Berger in Ways of Seeing. \"The relation between what we see\nand what we know is never settled.\"\nAnd what is truly unsettling about these high profile police killings is that they\ndon't contradict what takes place daily in America but simply illustrate it.\nWhat was unsettling was those who questioned the wisdom of protesters in\nthose moments where the protests turned violent in Ferguson or Baltimore or\nelsewhere must at least acknowledge that the issue of police killings of black\npeople would not be a nationwide talking point had there been no violence.\nThat there would have been no federal investigation into Ferguson by the US\nattorney general without those riots. To quote the title of the cabinet paper,\nwritten by the then Conservative environment secretary, Michael Heseltine\nabout the uprisings in Liverpool and elsewhere in the early eighties: \"It took a\nriot\". And that if it takes a riot for America to remember the names of children\nkilled by police officers then that tells you more about the country than it does\nabout the rioters.\nIndeed what became clear following the Department of Justice report into the",
            "BERNIE GRANT\nTRUST\nFerguson police force was just what a state of day-to-day tyranny people in\nthat suburb were living under.\nTo cite just a few examples: between 2007 to 2014, one woman in Ferguson\nwas arrested twice, spent six days in jail and paid $550 as a result of one\nparking ticket for which she was originally charged $151. She tried to pay in\nsmaller instalments - $25 or $50 a time - but the court refused to accept\nanything less than the full payment, which she could not afford. Seven years\nafter the original infraction she still owed $541 - this was how the town raised\nits revenue. It was not a glitch in the system; it was the system.\nThen there was the man pulled out of his house by the police after reports of\nan altercation inside a home. As they dragged him out he told them: \"You\ndon't have a reason to lock me up.\"\n\"Nigger, I can find something to lock you up on,\" the officer told him.\n\"Good luck with that,\" the man responded. The officer slammed the man's\nface into a wall and he fell to the floor.\n\"Don't pass out, motherfucker, because I'm not carrying you to my car,\" the\nofficer is claimed to have said.\n-\nThis last story happened the same month Brown was killed. Were it not for\nthe disturbances following Brown's death, there would have been no\ninvestigation – not only would we have heard nothing of these things but,\nbecause no light had been shone on them, the Ferguson police would be\ncarrying on with the same level of impunity. This was a small midwestern\nsuburb few had heard of - unremarkable in every way, which is precisely\nwhat makes the goings on there noteworthy. If it was happening there, then it\ncould be happening anywhere.\n\"Terror,\" the anthropologist Arjun Appadurai writes in his book Fear of Small\nNumbers, \"is first of all the terror of the next attack.\" Most African Americans,\nof course, are not shot by the police. But few believe that what happened\nthere could not happen to them. The terrorism resides not just in the fact that\nit happens, but that one is braced for the possibility that it could happen to\nyou at any moment.\n\"Living in a state of terror was new to many white people in America,\" the late\nMaya Angelou told me when I interviewed her in 2002 in reference to the\nSeptember 11 attacks of the previous year. \"But black people have been",
            "BERNIE\nGRANT\nTRUST\nliving in a state of terror in this country for more than 400 years.\" Evidently\nthey still are.\nWhat is unsettling is that there are places in America where young people are\nnot supposed to die. Movie theatres. Schools. College campuses. Their\ndeaths prompt great moral panic if little change.\nAnd then there are areas where they are expected to die. The shooting of a\nteenager in poor black neighbourhoods often earns little more than a\nparagraph in the local paper. Beyond their communities, their passing\nprompts little more than a weary, familiar sigh. To exist as a working class\nAfrican-American is to be vulnerable: to live in a poor, black area simply\nrenders you collateral.\nSo each time these kids are shot we are told to wait until the facts came out\nbefore rushing to judgement. But \"to suspend judgment,\" wrote James\nBaldwin when covering a trial in 1982, \"demands that one dismiss one's\nperceptions at the very same moment that one is most crucially - and cruelly\n- dependent on them.\"\nFor the facts are out there.\nWe know that a black person is killed every 28 hours by the police or\nsomeone working in security.\nWe know that black kids are 21 times more likely to be shot by police than\nwhite kids.\nWe know that police stopped and frisked more than 4 million people in New\nYork in a decade, most of them black and Latino, and, according to their own\nfigures, 90% of them were innocent.",
            "BERNIE\nGRANT\nTRUST\nWe know that at current rates one in every three black boys born in 2000 will\ngo to jail.\nWe know that black youth do not use drugs at a greater rate than white youth\nbut are far more likely to be incarcerated for drug crimes.\nWe know that Black male life expectancy in Washington DC is lower than\nmale life expectancy on the Gaza Strip\nWe know that Black infant mortality in Chicago is on a par with infant mortality\non the West Bank\nWe know that black pre-schoolers (that's four year olds) are four times more\nlikely to be suspended than white pre-schoolers.\nWe know that there are more people in the US penal system than were\nimprisoned in the Soviet gulag at its height.\nWe know that because felons lose the right to vote there were more African\nAmerican men disenfranchised in 2004 than in 1870, the year male franchise\nwas secured.\nWe know that there are more African American men in prison on probation or\non parole in the US now than there were enslaved in 1850.\n\"You already know enough,\" wrote Sven Lindqvist in Exterminate All the\nBrutes. “So do I. It is not knowledge we lack. What is missing is the courage\nto understand what we know and draw conclusions.\"\nAnd so it's difficult not to come to the conclusion when we see what\nhappened to Michael Brown, and Eric Garner and Tamar Rice and Vonderrit\nMyers and Kajieme Powell and Oscar Grant and Freddie Gray, and Trayvon\nMartin and on and on, is that these are not statistical aberrations but systemic\nabominations. \"A system cannot fail those it was never meant to protect,\"",

This is the way the\nmatrix was designed.\nSo the grand jury deliberations, trials and convictions into these murders are\nnot just about the fate of a few police officers and a few dead black people -\nit's about the value of black life. It passed judgement on whether there was a\nprice to pay for summarily removing people from the planet or whether it's the\ncost of doing business when one person has a badge and a gun and the\nother has too much melanin.\n-\nUnder slavery, an owner would have to be reimbursed for a slave who was\ndeemed unreasonably slaughtered. Under Jim Crow they would leave\nlynched bodies hanging to warn others of the price of transgression – real or\nimagined. When Michael Brown's body was left lying lifeless on the streets of\nFerguson for four hours before the police collected it, it was an ugly metaphor\nfor the contempt for black life in this post-civil rights, post-industrial moment -\ndispensable, despised and discarded.\nJust take a step back for a moment and think through the hashtag\n#blacklivesmatter. You wouldn't have a hashtag that said\n#blackmencanplaybasketball or #blackmusicmatters because only the most\ndeluded would ever challenge that. But the reason #blacklivesmatter has\nresonated so widly is because it succintly summises where we are. We can\ncelebrate a black president, black professors, black astrophysicists, black\ntennis players all we want. But the issue of the sanctity of black life has still\nnot been settled.\nThe red pill is a very bitter pill to swallow and the rabbit hole is deep and dark.\nThat these uprisings should have come in the midst of a slew of 50th\nanniversaries from the civil rights movement - The Mississippi Freedom",

He won the case. The act was\ngutted. But those who go in search of this cure will find it quite elusive.\nThe discrepancy between black and white employment is the same as it was\n50 years ago The discrepancy between black and white wealth is greater; the\ndiscrepancy between black and white incarceration is greater. Black children\nacross the South now attend majority-black schools at levels not seen in four\ndecades.\nThis is not to say that we have literally reverted to a bygone era. \"No man\never steps in the same river twice,\" goes the proverb. \"For it's not the same\nriver and he's not the same man.\" We have a black president, a black\nattorney general and a black editor of The New York Times; there's a growing\ntrend to interracial relationships; suburbs are becoming more diverse. If the\ncivil rights movement had been about getting black faces in new and high\nplaces, its work would now be done. But it wasn't. It was about equality. And\nthe problem is not that we still have a great deal of progress to be made or\nthat progress is too slow-it's that we are regressing. And there is no place in\nthe myth for regression.\nHence the title - Black Lives Matter in the Age of Obama. For on the night of\nthe grand jury verdict which decided that Darren Wilson did not even have a\ncase to answer Obama did what presidents do in moments of strife. He came\non television and declared \"We are a nation based on the rule of law so we",
            "BERNIE GRANT\nTRUST\nneed to accept that this was the special jury's decision to make.\"\n-\nThe sight on a split screen, of the first black president appealing for calm on\none side, and alienated black youth looting and burning on the other – lays\nbare the limits of what constitutes success in the post civil-rights era. What\ndoes it mean to say that everyone is equal regardless of race in a nation\nwhere economic and social inequalities are not just endemic but actively\nencouraged as part of the national myth about success?\nSo these public executions of black civilians comes at a time when there is an\nunprecedented number of Black elected officials, corporate executives,\nmovies stars and athletes (in tennis and golf as well as boxing and\nbasketball).\nSo for Black America in many ways these are Dickensian times - they're the\nbest of times and the worst of times. Never have so many been doing so well\nand never have so many been doing so badly. When Obama catapulted to\nnational attention during the 2004 Democratic convention he wrapped himself\nin the flag with the claim: \"for as long as I live, I will never forget that in no\nother country on Earth is my story even possible\". But it is no less true that in\nno other Western country would 205 Black people have been shot dead\nalready this year. In no other Western country would Black America's poverty,\npoor health, poor housing and incarceration be possible.\nIndeed the class and economic disparity is even more pronounced among\nAfrican Americans than it is among whites. For whites, the richest among\nthem have 74 times more wealth than the average white family. But among\nAfrican Americans, the richest families have 200 times more wealth than the\naverage Black family.\nWith these levels of inequality within Black America a reckoning is in order",
            "BERNIE\nGRANT\nTRUST\nabout what we mean by black power. Do we mean the broad uplift of a\nhistorically oppressed community or the elevation of a handful of prominent,\nhigh profile individuals. So long as the system of oppression remains in tact\nthe identity of those administering it holds only symbolic relevance.\nIn fact having black people at the helm who don't change helps deflect\naccusations of racism. People become fixated on what an organisation looks\nlike rather than what it does. As a result the principal of fighting anything\nstructural racism becomes eclipsed by a desire to look different and act the\nsame. Those who start out campaigning for equal opportunities end up\nsettling for photo opportunities.\nWhen I interviewed the Black radical Angela Davis in 2007 she told me: \"The\nRepublican administration is the most diverse in history. But when the\ninclusion of black people into the machine of oppression is designed to make\nthat machine work more efficiently, then it does not represent progress at all.\nWe have more black people in more visible and powerful positions. But then\nwe have far more black people who have been pushed down to the bottom of\nthe ladder. When people call for diversity and link it to justice and equality,\nthat's fine. But there's a model of diversity as the difference that makes no\ndifference, the change that brings about no change.\"\nObama has insisted that the US is “a nation of laws.\" This is no doubt true.\nWithout further clarification and qualification it is also meaningless.\nThe trouble is that the United States, for far longer than it has been a \"nation\nof laws\", has been a nation of injustice. And in the absence of basic justice\nsuch laws can amount to little more than codified tyranny. It was no less a\nnation of laws when they jailed children as young as 6 in Birmingham,\nAlabama or massacred Native Americans and stole their land. The question is\nwhom these laws are supposed to serve and protect, by what means and to",
            "what end.\nBERNIE GRANT\nTRUST\n\"The law,\" wrote James Baldwin, \"is meant to be my servant and not my\nmaster, still less my torturer and my murderer.\" And so the call for law and, at\ncertain points, in times of revolt, order, has no meaning without an\nassessment of the order that prevailed. Those who call for law and order\nmust understand that there is no order because men with badges have been\nacting lawlessly. What peace can their be when an 18 year old can be shot\ndead while walking down the street with his hands up in a surrender position.\nWhat order are we to observe when a man selling cigarettes on the street can\nbe strangled to death. The truth is that almost all the significant gains that\nblack people have made towards full citizenship, in America, and indeed\nacross the world, have come not by observing the law but by breaking it.\nIt is through this chasm, between the official claim to an impartial legal system\nand the legacy of endemic racial injustice, that so many of these trigger-\nhappy police officers make their escape, with the flames of the ghetto in hot\npursuit. For when so few policemen are indicted, let alone convicted, of killing\nblack people they comprise not a special category, but a protected and\nelevated one. In this \"nation of laws” those charged with enforcing the law\nevidently operate above it, while the judiciary exists not to mediate between\nthe police and the public but to defend them from the public. Once again, this\nis not a bump in the road. This is the road.\nSo this is not a morality play in which a decent, black people are slain by\nmalicious, white cops. The inherent nature of the injustice was not systematic\nbut systemic. If we are to believe the DOJ report into Ferguson the entire\nsystem was corrupt and somehow Darren Wilson came out unscathed. This\nwhy the efforts to both defile the assailants character and even defend the",
            "BERNIE GRANT\nTRUST\ncharacters of the dead are so wrongheaded.\nThe Right concentrate on character defamation. Brown was a thug, they say.\nHe allegedly stole cigarillos. He deserved to die. Tamar Rice shouldn't have\nbeen playing with a gun in a park. Where were his parents. And Black people\nbrought into this too. At Brown's eulogy Al Sharpton emphasised. \"Blackness\nhas never been about being a gangster or a thug,\" Sharpton continued.\n\"Blackness was, no matter how low we was pushed down, we rose up\nanyhow.\"\nBut here's the thing. Thugs have rights too. Thugs are human beings too.\n#Thugslivesmatter. In this nation of laws the penalty for stealing cigarillos is\nnot summary execution. And those who don't understand that but who claim\nto be on the side of justice will forever be trying to justify why someone was\nnot worthy of a bullet rather than protecting any person's right to walk the\nstreets in safety. Were this an isolated episode we could talk in terms of\nindividuals. But it's not. They are structural. So these personalities are at best\nsecondary if relevant at all.\nYou can't fight white supremacy by behaving better. Indeed we know from\nmovements passed that it was when we filled the jails and taking to the\nstreets that things started moving. These young kids can pull their pants up\nall they like - and frankly I wish they would – they still won't be able to outrun\na cop's bullet.\n-\nSimilarly the police officers in question do not need to be evil. They just need\nto operate in an institution where the chance that you will sanctioned be for\nkilling a black youth is minimal and in a culture where armed white people can\ncite their fear of unarmed black people as a defence. A fear so intense that\nthey have to shoot them. Have to. Since, apparently, no other possible",
            "BERNIE GRANT\nTRUST\noutcome was possible. Such fears do not come from nowhere. To assume\nthat when you see a black man you see a criminal is rooted in the fact that\nblack men have been systematically criminalised.\nSo what now. What next? What we have seen so far have been very popular\nmediated interventions and eruptions that have, significantly, gained global\nattention. But popularity isn't the same as efficacy. It has found an audience.\nIt has yet to develop a program.\nThis is in no small part as much about the moment as the movement. In the\npost-civil rights era racism, much like neo-liberal globalisation, has become a\nforce without a face. Black people can be whatever they want to be,\nindividually, so long as it's not equal as a group. We can have a black\npresident so long he does not stand too openly and too closely alongside\nblack people. We can revel in him singing Amazing Grace so long as he has\nditched his radical black preacher and is singing at a black funeral.\nThis is why comparisons between this moment and the civil rights era fall\nshort. Back then there were clear targets. when they marched over Edmund\nPettus Bridge in 1965 in Selma they were marching for the vote. When they\nwent on the freedom rides in 1961 they were trying to integrate interstate\ntravel. When they marched in Birmingham in 1963 they were opposing\nsegregation.\nToday the signs are down, the abstract rights exist, the physical barriers are\ngone. And yet equality has not arrived. Racism is so utterly embedded in our\ninstitutions - from the courthouse to the schoolhouse - that to unpick one part\nis to make the whole thing unravel. So literally where do we march? To the\njail; to the police stations; to the courts; to the governers' mansion? And when\nwe get there what do we demand? An end to racism? What would that even",
            "BERNIE\nGRANT\nTRUST\nlook like? Police cameras? How much good did that do Eric Garner?\nThese are problems to which we dn't have the answers. What is encouraging\nis that we are starting to ask the right questions. At least we are mobilised,\neven if we don't exactly know where we're going. The blue pill is a sedative. It\nputs you to sleep believing a cure is round the corner only to wake up and\nfind that nothing has changed. The red pill offers some clarity but no cure. It\nshows you how deep the rabbit hole goes but it cannot show you how to get\nout."

His speeches were often powerful and moving, and always listened to intently. He was often too in advance of public opinion, his speeches attracting much controversy at the time – although in many cases this may be hard for us to understand given changes in public opinion on many issues, such as racism and anti-apartheid.\nYou can access his parliamentary questions and  speecheshereon theThey Work For Youwebsite.\nLord Gifford’s Broadwater Farm Inquiry Report nowavailable to download\nThirty years ago saw the worst ever rioting  in the UK, after black mother Cynthia Jarrett died as police raided her home, following rising tension between police and the black community in Tottenham, North London. The death of policeman PC Keith Blakelock during the riot, on the Broadwater Farm Estate, prompted outrage nationally –  but also locally, as the search for those responsible rode roughshod over civil rights, leading to widespread racist vilification, and ultimately the wrongful conviction of innocent individuals.\nThe independent Broadwater Farm Inquiry, chaired by Lord Gifford pre-dates the digital age, and has not previously been available on-line.  It was commissioned by the local authority to establish the truth about what happened, and reported in 1986. It countered many of the disturbing myths which had already grown up about  the events of 1985, and placed them in the context of urban and policing policies of the day, and of highly racialised media bias. For the first time, we make the report available digitally.\nClick here to go to the chapter by chapter downloads.\n30thAnniversary of the Broadwater Farm disturbances of 1985\nThe riots on the Broadwater Farm Estate in Tottenham in 1985 were described as the worst ever on mainland Britain.  A policeman PC Keith Blakelock was sadly killed during the riots and there followed months  of intense media focus on the estate, on the search for the culprits, and on Bernie Grant himself.  It was in this climate that three young men, Winston Silcott, Mark Braithwaite, and Engin Raghip were wrongly convicted of the murder in 1987, only to be released  four years later when it was found that the evidence against them had been fabricated.\nThis newly discovered original paper by the late Dorothy Kuya, believed to have been written during her work for an enquiry into the disturbances,  examines the distortions and racism which characterised the media coverage during those early months.\nClick onthis linkor the image below to download the report.\n\nThe Bernie Grant Memorial Lecture 2015by Gary Younge.  10th September 2015\nThe award winning Guardian journalist Gary Younge gave the Bernie Grant Memorial Lecture 2015 at the Bernie Grant Arts Centre, Tottenham, London N15 on 10th September 2015.\nAfter more than a decade of reporting in the USA Gary Younge argued that even as America celebrates the election of a Black president, the sanctity of black life is still denied. The litany of black people being murdered by police and the large number of policemen who get away with it, provides an ugly metaphor for the contempt for black life in this post-civil rights, post-industrial moment – dispensable, despised and discarded.\nThe lecture was followed by a discussion chaired by Rt. Hon Keith Vaz MP – Chair of the Select Committee on Home Affairs with panellists Deborah Owhin, Nathanial Tobias Coleman, Miranda Grell, and Phillip Udeh.\nTEXT of 2015 Bernie Grant Memorial Lecture\n\nThe following is a link to some photographs of the event.\nhttp://www.allimages.net/blacklivesmatter/\nMarginalised No More:  Marking the 15th anniversary of Bernie’s death, a celebration of black political representation\n\nOn 8th April 2015 at The Bernie Grant Arts Centre in Tottenham a well attended event was held in memory of Bernie’s life.  It focused on his achievements and drew attention to black and minority ethnic candidates standing for parliament in May 2015.\nYou can see an album of photographs of the evening by local photographer David Tothill by clickinghere."

His father, Eric, was a headmaster and, later, principal of a Teachers’ Training College. His mother, Lily, was a highly respected teacher, both in Guyana and in Haringey, North London and several of his close relatives also chose education as their profession, including his uncle, Basil Blair, who was a President of the Guyana Trades Union Congress.\nBernie was the second child and second son of five children and spent three years at his father’s primary school in Ituni, one of the bauxite-mining districts of Guyana. He returned to Georgetown at the age of nine to attend Sacred Heart Roman Catholic School, from where he won a scholarship to St Stanislaus College, a Jesuit boys’ secondary school.\nThe area in which he grew up in Georgetown, Charlestown, was very diverse with rich and poor families of different races and Bernie was very popular, since he was sociable and good at sports, especially cricket and basketball.\nAlthough he passed his O Levels with flying colours, Bernie left school a year later because he wasn’t allowed to study his preferred subjects. He then worked for two years as a laboratory analyst before he left for England to join his family.\nOn arriving in England Bernie attended Tottenham Technical College before going on to study engineering at Heriot-Watt University, Scotland. He left University in 1969 in protest against discrimination against black students. For the next 9 years, he became an International Telephonist, quickly becoming involved in the Union of Post Office Workers, fighting for the rights of fellow workers. In 1978 he became a full time Area Officer for NUPE, responsible for its local authority and health workers. Bernie founded the Black Trades Unionists Solidarity Movement, and worked for it full time between 1981 and 1984."

He famously attended his first State Opening of Parliament in African dress, attracting outrage in some quarters – but huge respect in others.\nIn Parliament he founded the Parliamentary Black Caucus, and took a leading role in establishing contacts with black people and politicians throughout the world. He travelled widely, especially to Africa and to his beloved Caribbean region. In 1990 he accompanied Rev Jesse Jackson to South Africa, greeting Nelson Mandela on the day of his release. Later he established an information technology centre amid the townships in the Free State, which is named after him.\nHe was Chair of the All Party Group on Race and Community, and of the British Caribbean Group. In 1997 he was appointed as member of the Select Committee on International Development, and he was the only MP amongst those appointed to the Home Secretary’s Race Relations Forum in 1998. He founded the Standing Conference on Racism in Europe in 1990, and also established the Africa Reparations Movement in Britain. In 1995, he founded the Global Trade Centre. A dedicated constituency MP, his last battle was to establish a major arts and cultural facility in his Tottenham constituency, a project which has been progressed since his death and will now be named The Bernie Grant Centre.\nOn the floor of the House of Commons he was outspoken in the cause of eliminating racism both in Britain and the world. He campaigned against racist policing methods, and deaths in custody, on institutionalised racism in health, housing and education, for refugees, and for greater resources for inner city areas. Internationally he fought for the elimination of overseas debt for poor nations, and for the recognition of the past injustices of colonisation and enslavement.\nContrary to popular belief, however, he fought not only for racial justice, but for oppressed people whoever they were. Many thousands valued him for the individual attention he gave to their personal difficulties.\nBernie Grant channelled the concerns of his community to the highest levels of Government, and was regarded as the authentic voice of Britain’s ethnic minorities. By the time of his death, the outspoken activist of the seventies and eighties, was seen as a statesman of great integrity. His funeral at London’s Alexandra Palace in April 2000, attended by some 5000 people from all sectors of society confirmed his standing and impact on public life.\non the They Work For You websiteYou can access his parliamentary questions and  speecheshereon theThey Work For Youwebsite.\n"

Bernie Grant had been the Labour leader of Haringey Council during the politically turbulent late 1980s and early 1990s, and went on to become the Member of Parliament for Tottenham, a multi-cultural area of north London.\nThe 4,000 people who attended the service at Alexandra Palace made this one of the largest ever public tributes at a funeral of a black person in Britain.\nBy the time of his death, the activist of the 1970s and 1980s was seen as a statesman of rare integrity. Cabinet Ministers, scores of MP’s, ambassadors and high commissioners, Scotland Yard Officers and most notable black British figures attended the funeral at Alexandra Palace. His family were joined by members of the public, black and white in equal measure, united in a multi-cultural celebration of his life. Locally, Alexandra Palace was known as the People’s Palace: it was a fitting place for the many who admired his tireless struggle against injustice to unite in a multi-cultural celebration of Bernie Grant’s life.\nHere are just a sampling of the countless tributes found within the condolence books, letters, cards and press obituaries held within the archive – all bearing witness to the immense affection in which he was held on his untimely passing on 8 April 2000:\n“Though in life he was an outspoken maverick, in death, Bernie Grant was praised from the heights of the Establishment, from Cabinet ministers and Scotland Yard to political associates and black community leaders”.Campaign group Operation Black Vote\n“Bernie touched the lives of so many people in a lifetime’s work as both a national and local politician, and there will be a great sadness today. We have lost a great fighter and a champion of justice for oppressed people everywhere. He had a huge heart and I guess that he just wore it out.”,  said by Sharon Grant, Bernie Grant’s widow\n“Bernie will be remembered as a hugely popular man of the people that every black man and woman should aspire to emulate”.Lee Jasper, Grant supporter, and chair of the National Black Alliance and the campaign group Operation Black Vote\n“Bernie Grant’s death left a huge sense of loss. Here in Tottenham you lost a dedicated MP, and for many of you, a dear friend. The black community across Britain lost an inspiration. And injustice everywhere lost a fierce opponent.”,  said by Prime Minister Tony Blair\n“Some people think it reasonable to support the view that Bernie Grant and the police were on different sides. Nothing could be further from the truth.”,  said by Chief Superintendent of Police Steven James\n“With great love, affection and gratitude to the man who first let me in the door at Westminster. Love always Oona.”,  said by MP Oona King’s personal sentiments as recorded within the Alexandra Palace condolence book\n“Respect Dear Brother. Respect. Yours was a true and great heart. Paul Boateng.”,  said by MP Paul Boateng’s personal reverence for Bernie as expressed in the Alexandra Palace condolence book\n“He was trying to help everybody. That’s the kind of son I had. Bernard Alexander Montgomery Grant”Eric Grant\n“When the funeral procession slowed down, I saw people from all races go to feel that coffin. That struck me. Never mind the talking. That was an outpouring of grief and respect for a man who helped me regardless of my colour.”,  said by Alex Saunders\n“Bernie’s achievement was huge in making our society more tolerant and decent.”,  said by Mr Jack Straw, Home Secretary\n“Bernie was a great friend to the Kurds. We were shocked and upset by the news of his death. We would like to express our sympathy to you for your loss and we have lost a great friend too”. said by The Kurdish Community Centre\n\nTestimonials by others:\n\n“Bernie was a real champion for the rights of Irish and black people in Britain and his loss at the early age of 56 is a great blow”.Pat Reynolds, Haringey Irish in Britain Representation Group\n“You started something that united everyone together”\n“…Bernie was our voice on many issues. He was very considerate and thoughtful. Who spoke on behalf of the OROMO in Ethiopia…”\n“Thank you for all of the support you offered to families living with HIV/AIDS…”\n“The people of Tottenham have a lost a star in their crown…”\n“Farewell Bernie. The people of Tottenham have lost a wonderful representative – someone who would take up the day to day personal problems of ordinary working people, however large or small…We pledge to continue the fight for a just society – the people of Tottenham can stand tall and be proud of one of their finest sons.”\n“A son of Guyana’s soil, a leader, a fighter, who should be remembered not only in Guyana, Great Britain but the world at large.”,  \n“Equal Opportunities moved on 200 years because of you (maybe even 2000)…”\n“We will miss your strength, laughter and ability to challenge in the face of defeat”\n“You carried the Black man’s burden in the corridors of power.

Unfortunately, few of them will be aware of the legacy of a generation which itself in the 1980’s demanded and struggled for its place in British society.\nThis project will use the Bernie Grant Archive to enable young Londoners to understand this legacy, and learn from it, as they face racially charged threats to their identity and rights as citizens and consider their options. The archive provides a rich source of material about the social conditions which drove the black community to enter representative politics as active citizens, the strategies they adopted, and the responses of the wider community to demands for equality and a shared identity. Focusing on the eventful years of 1983-1993 in London, the project explores this critical moment in Britain’s journey to becoming an inclusive society.\nBuilt around four themes this project will use the archive and the example of Haringey to explore the social and economic conditions and pressures that helped to shape Black British identity at the time, the responses to those pressures, the impact that these actions had not only on the Black British community but also on wider society:\nEvidence will be drawn from the archive about the reality of disadvantage for the Black community. This will include the facts about inequality locally and nationally in housing, education, the workplace and policing, using the many examples in the collection of how this affected individual lives.\nUsing archive material, the focus will be on the way the Black community responded to these inequalities. Using the many examples present in the collection a range of responses will be explored e.g. self-help, artistic expression, community action, public demonstrations, seeking and gaining public office and civil unrest. Taken together these responses form the foundations for a Black British identity; fleshing out what it means to be Black and British.\nThrough the archive the concept and definition of leadership will be explored, and the importance of this for a marginalised community previously without recognised leadership. Numerous examples will be used to illustrate questions about the meaning of leadership, the personal qualities required, the risks and challenges, not least as regards transitioning into representative politics as a minority ethnic leader.\nAlso explored will be the impact of this new type of leadership for the community’s confidence in their identity and sense of belonging.\nWhat it is to be Black and British has changed considerably over the past 25 years. This theme explores this and encourages use of the material in the previous themes to promote discussion about the current challenges to identity and citizenship rights. Discussion of both similarities and differences between current threats to identity, and those facing the black community in the 1980’s, will be encouraged as well as the place of active citizenship in today’s context.\nThe project will be delivered across 3 strands of activity\nStrand 1- Developing Schools ResourcesThis strand will work with teachers and students to develop a suite of curriculum linked resources that can be used by teachers in the class room as well as by students and learners as part of an independent study programme.Strand 2: Developing Young Producers and Bringing Stories AliveThe project will enable 12 young people (18-25) to gain heritage skills in research and interpretation by getting up close and hands on with archive material, and creatively interpreting it. They will participate in a programme of activity that will see them receive training and support, to develop workshops, brief and commission artists and to then produce and manage public events that engage their peers and increase understanding and knowledge of the project’s themes. The young producers will work with Emergency Exit Arts on an intensive programme of skill-specific training focused on preparing them to work collaboratively with each other. Through learning how to commission and brief artists young people will learn essential skills such as communication, negotiation, and evaluation; building their confidence and knowledge to deliver peer-centred activities and creative workshops directly inspired by the archive.\n\nStrand 3 Heritage AmbassadorsFinally, the project will train 30 people to be heritage ambassadors. These ambassadors will receive an introduction to the archive from the Trust’s lead archivist. They will also receive from the oral history society at least 4 days of training on conducting, recording and selecting interviews. Once trained the ambassadors will interview a cross section of people in Haringey and across London about their experiences or memories of exclusion and struggle during the period, about social action they were involved in, the leadership role of Bernie Grant, as well as their reflections on the position today. They will interview politicians such as Diane Abbott, Keith Vaz, David Lammy, Sam Gyimah and Chuka Umunna alongside former council colleagues and the wider community paying particular attention to people aged between 50 and 65, who would have been young people in the 1980s. Heritage Ambassadors will collect a total of 120 oral testimonies\n\nOBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT1. Participants will have learned about the heritage/history.\nGET INVOLVED\n\nTAKE PART IN OUR SURVEY\n‘Calling all teachers and educational professionals, The Bernie Grant Archive needs your help!\nPlease complete our short survey about how we can best support your teaching to develop relevant and meaningful educational resources’\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeSFeYr4kKi_8Kv69AGvJT_Yrd0_GcW4TUCTBDQxK4LgmVbrw/viewform?usp=sf_link\n"

He was the first historian of African heritage to become a Professor of History in Britain when he was appointed Professor of the History of Africa and the African Diaspora in 2015. In 2018 he launched the world’s first online MRes in the History of Africa and the African Diaspora which has trained many students of African and Caribbean heritage as historians, including six currently engaged in PhD research. In what can only be described as an attack on Black history and training Black historians, in August 2023 the University of Chichester unilaterally suspended all recruitment to the MRes and terminated Hakim’s employment. In this lecture, Professor Adi reminds us of the importance of the History of Africa and the African Diaspora, what it teaches us about the world we live in today, and the need to fight to ensure this history is protected, better known and understood.\nMeet the panel:\n\n“It’s not a “Culture War”, it’s a War on Culture. It’s being waged against our arts, culture and heritage organisations, and against our universities under the banner of a “war on woke”. Using Frantz Fanon’s essay on Racism and Culture as a guide, and taking stock of the 125th anniversary of the 1897 looting of the Benin Bronzes, the talk brings those issues up to date by asking what an anti-racist, anti-war movement for culture could look like today, as we resist ongoing assaults against education, equality and the arts”. This lecture was given by Professor Dan Hicks, a writer, curator and Professor of Contemporary Archaeology at Oxford University. His most recent book, The Brutish Museums: the Benin Bronzes, Colonial Violence and Cultural Restitution (Pluto Press)Panel discussion and audience Q&A, chaired by Roger McKenzie.\nMeet the Panel:\n\n\nThe 2020 Memorial Lecture was delivered by Jeremy Corbyn, in his final public appearance as leader of the Labour Party. During his time as party leader, Labour’s membership numbers soared as people were attracted to his anti-austerity stance and informal, socialist style of politics. Alongside his long political career, Corbyn is an activist who participated in Anti-Fascist Action, the Anti-Apartheid Mocement, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and has been a longstanding advocate for a united Ireland and recognition of Palestinian statehood. In this lecture, Jeremy Corbyn shares some memories of his good friend, colleague and comrade Bernie Grant.\n\nThe 2019 Memorial Lecture took place on 10th April and was delivered by Professor Kehinde Andrews. Prof. Andrews is the first ever UK professor of Black Studies and has attracted media attention on the matter of decolonising the curriculum. His bookBack to Black: Retelling Black Radicalism for the 21st Centurygenerated considerable debate about black radical thought and its relevance to today’s discussion about race.\nThe following link will take you to an audio recording of the lecture:\nAudio recording\n"

            "SPEECH BY BERNIE GRANT M.P. TO THE INTERNATIONAL\nSYMPOSIUM OF THE DANISH BOARD FOR ETHNIC\nEQUALITY, COPENHAGEN, 8TH MAY 1996,\nTha\nhank you chairperson. May I start by thanking the Board for Ethnic Equality for inviting\nme to address this symposium. Can I start by reiterating the point made by Peter\nwhen he said that we are here to teach and to learn. I certainly would support that view\nbecause I think it's important in today's world that people are able to communicate, that\nwe are able to share our experiences, that we are able to learn from others.\nI think I better start by introducing myself. My name is Bernie Grant and I am a member\nof the British Parliament. I came to Britain from Guyana in 1963 when I became involved\nin politics in a serious way, first of all through the Labour movement and then in local\ngovernment, as a response to the wide spread racism that was prevalent in Britain during\nthe '60s and the '70s. I eventually became the Leader, or mayor as you say in some\ncountries, of my local authority in 1985 and was subsequently elected to Parliament in\n1987, for my constituency of Tottenham, North London - a constituency in which about\n40% of the population are from Black and ethnic communities.\nIn my constituency, we have people from Ireland, who consider themselves to be an ethnic\nminority in Britain, we have people from Africa and from the Caribbean, and from Cyprus\n- we have the largest number of Cypriots outside of Cyprus. We have people from the\nIndian sub-continent and we have people from the orthodox Jewish community; those are\nthe main ethnic groups. We have the highest number of refugees in any constituency in\nBritain and this is due to the fact I suppose that we have a multi-cultural and a multi-racial\ncommunity in my constituency. We have no racial conflicts whatsoever, and I think this\nis due to the actions and the attitudes of people over the past 20 years in my constituency.\nI want to start off today by putting this conference in the context of the situation in Europe\nand the situation in the world. I believe that there has been a sustained world-wide attack\non people of colour, in particular on refugees and asylum seekers. In the United States of\nAmerica, we have had people who are seeking refuge from Haiti, from Cuba and from\nChina. Some of these communities are being castigated by some of the politicians, people\nwho are running for President like Pat Buchanan, of the Right wing of the Republican Party,\nwho have used the whole question of immigration, and of refugees, to try to create\nproblems within the United States.",
            "2\nLets make no bones about it, they are not talking about refugees who are White, because\nin countries were there is a pre-dominance of White people, White refugees can just melt\ninto the population and have no problems. The problems come when we have refugees\nof colour, when you have Black people, Brown people and Yellow people in those\ncountries. In France, we have seen an attack on migrant peoples the like of which hasn't\nbeen seen for many years. The Pasqua laws are there to ensure that Black people know\ntheir place within France, in particular refugees and asylum seekers. In Germany there\nhave been many attacks on migrants on one sort or the other, whether it's been in\nHoyerswerde or in Solingen or many other places in Germany. We have also seen a\ntremendous attacks on refugees and asylum seekers in the United Kingdom, in my own\ncountry. At the government level we have seen legislation which will create serious\nproblems for Black and minority ethnic peoples. The European Union of course is busy\nmaking new regulations requiring entry visas, and they are harmonising their laws so that\nif you are rejected from one part of Europe, all the other countries will reject you as well.\nThe first point that I want to make in relation to this is that a lot of European people see\nBlack people as one mass of people, all the same. We all look the same and we are all the\nsame - but that is not the case for many reasons, including historical reasons, which I shall\nnow briefly talk about.\nWhen 1 left Guyana in 1963 and went to Britain, I was not an immigrant and have never\nconsidered myself as one, because Guyana was part of the British Commonwealth. We\nwere all part of the British empire. We were all citizens of the British empire, so that I\ndon't consider myself to be an immigrant but a full citizen.\nIn Britain, people from the Commonwealth have the same rights as British citizens. If you\nare settled in Britain, you are entitled to everything that a British citizen born in Britain is\nentitled to, and we have a different status from refugees and asylum seekers. The Black\npeople in France are French citizens, whether you come from Guadeloupe, Reunion Island\nin the Indian ocean or Martinique, you are French. You can walk into France whenever\nyou please. That means we are in different categories and I think it's important for people\nwho are dealing with race issues to begin to understand that within the whole question of\nBlack and migrant people we have different statuses between ourselves. And of course you\nhave migrant people who are here because of problems in their country or whatever. So\nwhen people talk about migrants and they include me and my children I get very upset\nabout this, because we are not migrants, we are full British citizens and as such we are of\ncourse citizens of Europe.\nNow, the reason of course that there are so many Black and migrant people in Europe is\nbecause the Europeans were in Africa, in the Caribbean, in Asia and all over the world.\nThe Europeans used the whole question of divide and rule in order to rule the countries of\nAfrica and, it's important that we look at the history of Europe and see that Europe, and\nespecially Britain's, Industrial Revolution was fueled by the exploitation of the countries\nin the Commonwealth. For example, there was fruit from countries in the Caribbean -\nsugar, oranges, fresh fruit, bananas - that came into Europe\nthat came into Europe bringing an unheard of\nimprovemnt in nutritional standards. When the Industrial Revolution came, it came on the",
            "3\nbacks of the colonial peoples and on the backs of the enslaved peoples, the slaves who were\ntaken from Africa and this happened in all the countries.\nDenmark itself had it's colonies - St. Croix, St. Thomas and others in the Caribbean, that\nI know of. We have the situation with Belgium and France in Africa Senegal, Togo,\nRwanda. In fact, the question of Rwanda today is there because of the whole way in which\nthe French and the Belgians dealt with the people of Rwanda, how they divided them up\nand ruled. The problems in Uganda today the reason why there are Ugandan refugees\nin Europe today is because the British took Idi Amin, who was from a minority tribe in\nUganda, and put him in charge of the majority, so that when the British left the majority\nof course rebelled. This is what the British did. In Cyprus, they took the Turkish people\nwho were fewer, and put them in charge of the Greeks Cypriots and so on. This was a\ntactic that was used by all of the colonial powers. So, in fact we are here in Europe\nbecause you were there in Africa. That's the reason that we are here. The chickens are\ncoming home to roost. I want to make that point clear.\nNow, apart from what is happening in terms of race, there is what is happening\neconomically and politically in the world. With the demise of the Soviet Union and the\nNew World Order, there has been a setting up of trading blocks around the world. In the\nfar east, around China and Japan etc., in the United States of America, around the US,\nCanada and Mexico, the North American free Trade Agreement and of course the\nEuropean Union. And these three trading blocks are trading amongst themselves and\namongst each other. In doing so they are setting up rules and regulations that are making\nit very difficult for countries in Africa and other parts of the world to exist because they\nare being squeezed by these three political, social and economic blocks.\nOne example of this is the GAAT regime, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.\nWhat that does is make it almost impossible for there to be any kind of protection for\nsmaller countries from larger countries. The European Union for instance, has the Lome\nAgreement between the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, some 59 countries\naltogether. They have preferential trade agreements in relation to sugar, bananas, rum, rice\nand so on and so forth. The Lome agreement has represneted at least in part a recognition\nof an obligation towards the former colonies on the part of their former colonisers. What\nGAAT has done now is said that there will be no more of these special arrangements, and\nbecause of that it means there is increased pressure on those countries so they now have\nto compete. In the case of bananas, you have a small country in the Caribbean like\nDominica or St. Kitts or Grenada, having to compete with Honduras, Panama and some\nof these huge multnational mega corporations run by the American multi-nationals like\nChiquita and Dole and Del Monte and so on. That is causing problems.\nThe fact is that the European countries and the G7 countries are taking aid and moneys\naway from Africa and those other countries and putting it into Eastern and Central Europe,\nto the detriment of those countries, means that there is even more poverty being created\nin those countries, which leads to more animosity, more divisions in those countries. This\nleads to wars, and civil strife, which in turn leads to more refugees and asylum seekers\ntrying to get out of those countries and a lot of those people choose to come to Europe",
            "4\nto seek refuge. And what we have is the European Union taking the position that they are\ngoing to try their best not to adhere to the 1951 United Nations Convention on Refugees\nand try to find all sorts of ways to ensure that those people do not get a safe haven in these\ncountries.\nI raise these points as a background to the situation that Black and minority people find\nthemselves in, in Europe and in the rest of the world. And of course in Britain, there have\nbeen major waves of immigration in the 1950s and the 1960s, and there was a lot of\novert racism at the time, racial attacks etc. Now, Black people and other people of colour\nin Britain have taken major strides to overcome this racism. We forced the government to\nset up a Race Relations Act, which is legislation making it unlawful to discriminate against\nsomeone on the basis of colour. Alongside the Act the Commission for Racial Equality was\nestablished, a body that monitors racism in Britain and has the authority to investigate\npublic bodies and private companies if a complaint of racism is made. We have had a\npolitical movement of Black and other minority ethnic groups. That movement decided\nit would become involved in the politics of the country and as such we were then able to\ninfluence local authorities and municipalities who acknowledged the whole question of\nracism, including the cultural dimension and the language dimension. We have thus seen\nsigns of progress.\nWe have also had more negative experiences. We have had people rioting in the streets\nand of course the reason that people riot is because they feel they don't have a voice. They\naren't able to get their feelings heard and I think that's an important lesson for people to\nlearn. We've had our riots, but we've managed to make significant progress. We now have\nBlack people in all the professions; Black lawyers, Black judges, Black politicians, Black\npeople in sports representing Britain in all sporting activities. We have of course Black\npeople in business, in academic life, and so on. More importantly, to me, is that we have\nhad an absorption of Black culture by White young people in particular, so that the music,\nthe language that is spoken in London and other areas reflects the language of Black people.\nReggae music and the language that goes with that is all reflected in how all the youths\nspeak.\nHowever, the majority of Black people in Britain are still at the bottom of the pile and have\nhuge frustrations, particularly with regards to the lack of opportunity. For example, in my\nconstituency in Tottenham, 60% of Black young people aged between 16 and 24 years\nof age are unemployed. Sixty per cent. Now, I hear people talking about 10% and they\nstart to panic in Germany the unemployment figures are in double figures and the\nGermans are panicking. In my constituency in Tottenham, there is unemployment amongst\n60% of Black young people aged between 16 and 24 years. That is a government\nstatistic, I haven't made it up. So clearly there is a serious problem in relation to issues like\nunemployment.\nI suspect that part of the reason for this the attitudes taken by the Government, particularly\nthe government under Mrs. Thatcher. Her Government took away a lot of the gains that",
            "5\nhad been made and enabled politicians at the highest level to legitimise racist views. For\nexample, Mrs. Thatcher made a speech in which she said that Britain is in danger of being\nswamped by alien culture. You think about that. There are about 60 million people in\nBritain. There are about 4 million Black and Brown people and Mrs. Thatcher was afraid\nthat the culture of 56 million is going to be swamped by the culture of 4 million. Well,\nI have never heard anything like that in my life. I have never heard of 4 million people\nswamping 56 million. I know that in Scandinavia in general, there is a view that if you let\ntoo many people into your country, it will change the country, the language, the\nenvironment and your culture. Well, I think that if your culture is so shaky that a hand full\nof people are able to change it, well then maybe it's not worth having at all!\nWe have seen therefore, a reversal, particularly in recent years, of some of the gains that\nhad been made by Blacks and other minority and other migrant peoples. For example, we\nhave seen a lot of deaths in police custody. Every year about some 20 or so young people,\nmainly Black, die in police custody in one way or the other. We have literally thousands of\npeople who are stopped and searched and harassed by police officers for no reason every\nyear.. In fact, if you are living in London, you are 10 times more likely to be stopped and\nsearched by police if you are Black than if you are white. These are statistics that have\nbeen confirmed in Parliament. We have also heard statements from people like the\nMetropolitan Police Commissioner who says that young Black people are responsible for\nmuggings, as if you can put certain crimes to certain races. The Metropolitan\nCommissioner doesn't say that in parts of Britain where there are no Black people, 100%\nof the muggings are committed by White people, but he turns around and he says that in\nLondon the majority of the muggings are committed by Black people and that's wrong. You\ncannot attach certain crimes to certain races. You can't have race tagging of crimes.\nSo clearly the struggle in the United Kingdom needs to go on. We now have a new\nphenomena that has just come on the scene in Britain and I call it Corporate racism. This\nis racism by the big corporations. For example, Ford motor company, the big multi-\nnational, the other day took a picture of it's workforce, which included people from Africa,\nthe Caribbean, White people, Indian people, people from Pakistan and so on, a picture of\nabout 20 people who were all there looking very happy and smiling. And Ford decided\nthat they were going to advertise in Poland. And would you believe it, you know what\nthey did? They took all the Black faces and Whitened them out. They turned the White\npeople into Black people in the picture because they wanted to sell cars to Poland and\nPoland they say doesn't have many Black people, so they decided to change their\nworkforce into an all-White workforce.\n-\nHence, a man that was wearing a Sikh turban, had his turban removed and his face painted\nWhite it was absolutely disgusting. That is the kind of thing that is happening, because\nlarge corporations are saying now that if they have to sell their products to Eastern Europe,\nCentral Europe and other areas where there aren't many Black and minority people, then\ntheir advertising is going to be White, the pictures they use are going to be White and the\nsales people they are going to send down there are going to be White - and this is not on.\nIn this instance, Ford quickly apologised and paid compensation to the workers who had",
            "had their faces distorted.\n6\nNow, corporate racism is a new phenomenon. British Airways is another corporation that\nhas been caught - recently they were caught photocopying the passports of Black people -\nand Black people only - who were booked onto their flights.\nI think that if we are to move forward together in Europe, I think that there are five or six\nprinciples that must be followed. First of all, racism has to be openly discussed and their\nmust be an acceptance that racism exists. I think that's the first principle that I'd like to put\nforward to you. I've been to several national and international conferences which were\nsupposed to have been about racism, but at which it was never actually openly discussed.\nIt is dressed up in terms of a cultural problem and people talk about \"intolerance,\" and\n\"assimilation\" and integration and so on - in fact, there's an American who's of Indian\norigin, a Mr De Souza, who is currently touring Britain giving lectures. He has a theory that\nin America racism no longer exists, that's it the question of culture that's the problem, so\nthat the people who are most disriminated against, he says, are Muslims for instance, and\nother people who have a different culture from the dominant culture in the country. I\nwant to say that I disagree totally with that gentleman and if he happens to come to\nDenmark, I hope you'll send him packing because he's talking rubbish.\nWe want to be clear what we're talking about, particularly at this conference. We're\ntalking about discrimination on the basis of the colour of a person's skin. Nothing more\nand nothing less. That is the major problem. The visible minorities, people you can see\na mile off, those are the people who have difficulties within a White society.\nWe're not talking about culture - cultural issues are there but they are secondary, they are\nthe second phase. The main issue is the question of colour. For example, if you are a\nWhite South African and you know the culture of South Africa, or if you are from the\nCaribbean and you are White and you walk down the street in Britain or in Denmark, the\nfascist isn't going to attack you, and you can melt into the population. But if I am walking\ndown some streets in Britain and I assume some streets here as well, when they see me they\ndon't ask me if I'm a refugee or if I can speak Danish - because you are Black immediately\nyou are a target for attack and that is the difference. This is the difference for Black people\nand people of colour. I think that we need to remember that. So, we're talking mainly\nabout the colour of a person's skin. And we're talking about the ignorance and the\npsychological baggage which White people have about Black people.\nWe're not talking about integration either, because this in itself is no solution. We know\nfrom the United Kingdom that some of the brightest people around are Black - and when\nI say Black I use the term to mean Indian, Pakistani and so on, Black and Brown people -\nthey are some of the brightest people. In fact according, to recent statistics, 40% of\nAfrican people have qualifications of degrees or slightly under, and the list continues - 20%\nof Caribbean, 35% of Indian, 26% of Bangladeshis and so on. 15% of the White\npopulation have the same qualifications, and so in terms of qualifications per se, University",
            "7\ndegrees and so on, the Black population has a higher percentage in Britain, than the White\npopulation.\nHowever, when you look at unemployment, you see that Black graduates are four times\nas likely to be unemployed than White graduates. Therefore, something is wrong. It\ncannot be a question of culture, for they all went to the same schools, they all got the same\ndegrees, they all speak English - some of them even have English names. Yet when it comes\nto jobs, the Blacks are ten times more likely to be unemployed than their White\ncounterparts. Now that has nothing to do with culture, that has to do with racism, that's\nto do with the colour of a person's skin when they turn up for an interview at the work\nplace. Hence, people can be as integrated as possible, but they will still face racism because\nof the colour of their skin, so it's not a question of culture - although that is also a problem,\nand cultural racism is a problem that has to be dealt with.\n-\nHence, it must be accepted that racism on the basis of the colour of a person's skin exists.\nyou don't accept that, then if someone comes to complain of discrimination, then of\ncourse you will say that they don't have anything to complain about; like the French do.\nThe French say, \"well, in our constitution it's egality and fraternity and so on,\" but when\nyou go to France and you look in the ghettos, you see that the ghettos are all full of Black\npeople. The worst public housing is for Black people so you ask, \"Well, where is the\negality, and the fraternity?\" It's not there, it's only there in their minds when the reality\nis much different. It's all a question of having a colourblind approach. I was speaking to\nan employer the other day who was particularly bad in terms of hiring Black people. He\nsaid to me, \"I don't look at a person's colour, they can be green, they can be pink, they\ncan be polka dot, we have them here.\" I said, \"Yes, but you don't have Blacks, and you\ndon't have Browns and you don't have yellows. You might have polka dots, I haven't seen\nany, but you certainly don't have any Blacks here.\" This question of colour-blindness is a\nnonsense, it's there just to try and confuse people and to try and lead people astray. So,\nthe first principle that has to be followed is that in White societies wherever they are,\nracism exists and it has to be dealt with and it has to be openly discussed.\nSecondly, I think that there has to be an acceptance that Black and minority people have\na place within a changing, cosmopolitan Europe, which will never again be all White. I will\nrepeat that - there has to be an acceptance that Black and minority people have a place\nwithin a changing, cosmopolitan Europe, which will never again be all White. So, if you\nare a fascist who's looking\nfor the glory days when the Whites ruled the world, when they went all over the world and\nexploited the world and so on, well then you are going to have to find somewhere on the\nmoon, not on this Earth, because Europe will never be the same again. Black people are\nhere to stay in Europe and people had better believe it and better become accustomed to\nit. This is important. Now, if that is accepted, therefore the rights of Black and migrant\npeoples have to be addressed, otherwise there will be an underclass of people who will\nalways be at odds with the rest of society.",
            "8\nSo I would suggest that there has to be education in society at all levels, especially in\nschools. The education will have to be about history. About the process and consequence\nof enslavement, of colonization in particular and the immediate reasons why migrants find\nthemselves in this country and in the rest of Europe. I think that there has to be truth in\nthis matter. I don't care how unpalatable the truth might be to some people in this matter.\nSome people might want to forget that people were transported in hundreds and millions\nlike cattle - worse than cattle. You know there's all these animal rights people in Britain\nprotesting about how live calves are transported across the continent. Well, Black people\nwere transported in much worse conditions than this and nobody, very few people,\ncomplained about that, and.we want people to know about it.\nWe want young people in Europe to understand what that meant for Africa to have all\nthose people taken away from her, and also what it meant for those people who were sent\nabroad from Africa. I include the people who were taken by Denmark and the rest of the\nScandinavian countries and sent to places abroad. That story has to be told and it has to\nbe told truthfully. I think that if these matters are not explained properly, then the racists -\nwho we all hate - will be able to make easy propaganda and they will use this ignorance to\ninfluence people politically, like in France with Le Penn and in Germany with Shonhuber\nand so on. Because people will say, \"well why is it that these Black people keep coming\nto Europe, why is it? There must be something wrong with them. Why is it that Black\npeople are in the lowest positions in society, there must be something wrong with them.\"\nAnd you could easily begin to rewrite history and put the blame on the victims, rather than\non the perpetrators who created that situation. I think that the history of what transpired\nduring enslavement and during colonization still has to be told.\nUnless it is we will never understand the present.\nI think that people must be reminded constantly of the dangers of ignoring the rights of\nBlack and minority peoples, and of the consequences of racist philosophies, for example\nNazism. There can be no let up in this. Recently in the United Kingdom the two major\npolitical parties, the Conservatives and the Labour party, decided that they aren't going to\nhave much to do with race, they're going to put it on a back burner. They aren't going to\ntalk about race, they aren't going to encourage equal opportunity - they're going to forget\nabout it because it's uncomfortable and so on. As a result, in certain areas in London,\nfascists were elected for the first time. For example, in Tower Hamlets in East London, we\nhad fascist councilors elected for the first time and there was talk that there is going to be\na racist MP elected soon. When the fascist councillor was elected, on a pure race ticket,\nno other ticket, he broke all the laws by doing this and they never prosecuted him by the\nway. Then everybody started to shout and say \"we're all against racism\" and so on. But\nby then it was too late. He'd already been elected - luckily now however, it seems he has\nbeen removed. The lesson that I learnt from that is that if politicians don't tackle the\nquestion of race honestly, truthfully and openly than of course the fascists will move into\nthe space that has been created and create the conditions that will allow them to flourish,\nwhich none of us wants.",
            "9\nThe third principle that I think we should look at is this. I think there needs to be a\nrecognition of the positive contribution that Black and migrant peoples can make to the\neconomy, culture and life within European society. Let us take for instance refugees. Most\nrefugees who come into Europe are from middle-class backgrounds. They're doctors,\nthey're lawyers etc. They are usually from a professional class who are at odds with the\npolitical party or whoever is in power. They have good education and when they come to\nthese countries, instead of using that education, most countries in Europe put them in\nrefugee camps and hostels, don't give them any jobs. They give them maybe some welfare\nbenefit of some sort, but do not allow them to contribute to society.\nIn Britain, in my area, we have done the opposite to that. There are a lot of refugees from\nSomalia, Kurdustan, Zaire, Ethiopia and so on. We set up a refugee consortium, funded\nby the local authority, that looks at employment prospects, that uses the cultures of the\npeople to a positive advantage. For example we have people making all sorts of nice\nclothing and embroidery, which they sell and they are able to account for themselves. We\ndid something in the field of health. We set up a refugee health consortium and they had\ntwo things to do. First of all, some of them were doctors, and they began to work with\nlocal doctors and to explain to them the type of ailments that were likely to occur within\nthe refugee community how they recognise and treat\nThe second job that they had to do was to get to the refugees themselves and tell them\nwhat is expected of them in Britain, to show them how to use the health service and to\nexplain the kind of information doctors may require when they go to see them. That is a\npositive use of the resources that can be found within those communities. Best of all, by\ngiving them a little more additional training, those doctors themselves are able to look after\npeople from their communities. There are, then, positive aspects to this in terms of the\neconomy. We have decided to set up in my area a Global Trading Center, using the\nrefugees, the asylum seekers, and the Black and the migrant people, who contact the\npeople they know in their countries of origin in order to do business with them. We have\nset up all sorts of communication with the people in Tottenham and the people that they\nknow abroad, with many beneficial effects and that is proving very popular and very\nsuccessful for the economy of my neighborhood. It creates employment and of course the\nculture, music food, the restaurants, the arts and crafts that are there, and the whole\ncommunity bnefits. And people like living in a multi-cultural area because they are able\nto do things that people in the countryside, for instance, can't do and they experience\nthings that many others cannot. I think that young people in particular grow up with a\nmuch more enhanced perception of the world if they are able to meet with people from\nother communities. The world is no longer a place where people in Europe, for example,\nare isolated from people in America or people in Africa. Nowadays people travel much\nmore and so on. Young people in my area learn a huge amount from their own their\nschool friends, what these other countries are like.\nThe fourth point is that legislation has to be enacted to protect the rights of Black and\nminority ethnic people. In Britain we have the Race Relations Act and the CRE as I\nmentioned before, and I think that there needs to be set up a body which monitors both\nprivate and public sectors. There should be no exemption for any of these bodies. The",
            "10\npolice in particular need to be monitored. There needs to be an independent body that\nlooks specifically at complaints made against them, because of course a lot of Black people\nsuffer from abuse and from harassment at the hands of the police. The police are like no\nother section of society in that they have the power to take away the freedom of the\nindividual, which is the individual's greatest right. The police can deprive you of that right,\nso it is important that they are monitored and that there is transparency. In Britain we are\nnow talking about installing in police stations, in police vehicles, in the yard where the\nvehicles come in, video cameras that will record the police. We started off having tape\nrecordings when police interviewed suspects and now, as a result of a number of cases\nwhere the police have blatantly mishandled their authority, the Metropolitan Police have\nagreed to install these video cameras. This will make the police more transparent and the\npolice themselves are asking for this because they need to have the support and confidence\nof the public if they are to fight crime. The police can't run a crime-free society without\nthe full support of the public and in order to do that they need to be transparent.\nI also say that customs and immigration authorities need to be monitored properly by an\nindependent body. We are trying at the moment to have a new law enacted in Britain, and\nthat is one concerning racial violence. Racial violence can include abusive words,\nthreatening behavior, physical attack or incitement to racism. We think that that is quite\nimportant. The Conservative government have been trying to resist this, but we shall\ncontinue to press for it, especially when the new Labour government is elected. Another\nimportant issue regarding the law is the fact that the Treaty of Rome and the European\nCharter of Human Rights only have fleeting reference to the issue of racism and people's\nrights in relation to race. I think that racism is a denial of human rights and therefore it\nshould be in all of these treaties. I belong to an organisation called SCORE, the Standing\nConference on Racial Equality in Europe, and it is a part of our agenda to try and get a\nEuropean directive that will make racism a specific crime within the EU Countries. It is\nvery important to get proper legislation to assist in the fight against racism.\nFinally, Black and migrant people have to be given the right to self organisation and self\ndetermination. They also have to have the right to participate politically in the system of\nvoting, they have to have the right to vote. I don't think that in today's Europe, being anti-\nracist is enough. It is not enough to go on demonstrations against rasism. This is good, yes,\nand it is appreciated, but it is not enough. I have known many people who are strong anti-\nracists, who go on demonstrations etc., but who when you start talking about the rights of\nBlack people and the right to vote etc., start to get alarmed and say that that is going a bit\nfar. This is a crucial area that has to be tackled and I think that a true test of any anti-racist\norganisation is whether or not they are prepared to give power to Black people. I'm not\ntalking about giving a few handouts, I'm not talking about welfare benefits or a bit of\ncultural training and so on - I'm talking about real political power to Black and other\nmigrant people. Of course, if you don't have the vote, then you don't have rights, serious\nrights, because all these are political rights and if you are to change or improve them you\nneed to be able to influence the political parties. The only way you can do this is if you\nhave the right to vote. I can tell you that as a politician, most of my colleagues will take\nno notice of people who don't have the right to vote. They may feel sorry for them, but\nin the scale of priorities they will not take them seriously. It is hard enough to get",
            "11\npoliticians to take seriously Black people who do have the vote, let alone those who don't\nhave a vote. So this whole question of the vote is crucial. I don't know what the position\nis in Denmark, it's one of the things I hope to learn over the next few days. I do know\nthere was talk of allowing votes in local elections, but I don't know where you got to in\nregards to that question. I hope that those discussions move on apace also, as I am talking\nabout the national vote as well.\nI think that another important issue is the question of leadership within Black and migrant\ncommunities. I really think that people have to allow Black communities to pick their own\nleaders, not to have them picked for them. There is a very corrupt practice in the UK\nwhere White politicians, government officials and municipal officials of one sort or another,\nget their pet Black people, people that they have themselves have groomed, and place\nthese people at the table as leaders of their communities.\nThis is what the South Africans did with Chief Mangosuthu Butholazi. In order to counter\nthe ANC the National Party of the apartheid regime took this Butholazi out of obscurity\nand made him a big chief amongst the Zulus. They gave him money, they gave him\ninfluence and then put him in charge of the Zulus even though the Zulus had their own\nKing, Zweletini, and their own royal family and so on. They managed to sidestep the\nproper leadership within the Zulu nation and put it in the hands of Butholazi who was\nnothing but a errand boy for the South African racist regime. As a result of course, in\nNatal, there has been nothing but aggravation and fighting, because a lot of the Zulu\npeople do not support Butholazi - Butholazi himself has got his paid operators who go in\nand kill people and maim them and so on and so forth. That is an example in terms of the\nworst possible practice in terms of this, so what I'm saying is that we don't need that kind\nof development help - allow the communities to pick their own leaders. Whether you like\nthem or not is neither here not there. If they genuinely represent the views of the peoples,\nthen they are the people that you have to talk to. We have a name for those Black people\nwho allow themselves to be used in this way. We call them \"coconuts,\" - you know,\nthey're Brown outside, but they're white on the inside. That's what we call them and that's\nwhat they will remain - we have no time for them within the community.\nNow, in the UK, since Black people have gone into politics at a local and national level\nthey have changed the whole face of Black politics in Britain. People genuinely feel now\nthat they can get their issues aired. No longer is there the time when a White politician can\nget up in the House of Commons and say that Black people are all worthless, without some\nserious come-back, from one of the 6 of us - and their are only 6 of us Black members of\nParliament out of 651, but you can rest assured that in any discussions of race, immigration\nand any of those issues, by the time we gather our forces around us to oppose it in the\nHouse of Commons, any discussion is based on the facts of the matter, not on emotion and\nnot on racism. No White MP from any party dares now-a-days to get up in the House of\nCommons and say the things that they used to say many years ago. They know that the\nhostility they would get would be of such a magnitude that they would never be able to live\nit down. Now that it is televised, it makes it even more difficult. We can tell you therefore,\ndirectly from our experience, that the best way to deal with such issues is to have the\npeople speaking for themselves.",
            "12\nI want to say to you that there is now a major challenge facing those of us who are\nprepared to be counted and are prepared to do something about the .question of racial\nequality within Europe. I think that in Denmark you have made a real start by having such\na conference. I have been to conferences around Europe and I have never seen a\nconference quite like this, with it's variety of speakers not only form Europe and the\nminority communities in Europe, but also people from Africa who can tell us of their\nexperiences first hand. I think that the experience to be gained from such a conference\ncannot be understated. It's a marvellous idea and I really want to congratulate the Board\nfor Ethnic Equality in Denmark and of course the Government for allowing the conference\nto happen. I also have to say that even in Britain, where I think we are quite advanced in\nterms of race issues, I don't think we have had such a conference for many years, if ever.\nSo I want to congratulate you.\nHowever, I also want to warn that it is easy to have conferences and talk a lot. The\nFrench, for example, are brilliant at talking, they theorize everything. I was speaking to a\nBlack French politician the other day and he said, \"Look, the difference between you\nEnglish-speaking Blacks and us French-speaking Blacks is that you not only talked about it,\nbut you went out and took action. You might have taken some action that may have been\na bit unlawful or whatever, but at least you took some action about it. We, on the other\nhand, we sat down and we intellectualised the position with our oppressors. We sat down\nand we discussed it over cups of coffee. We sat around and we talked about the fight\nagainst racism and it was all theoretical, it was all in our heads, whereas on the ground it\nwas a totally different situation.\"\nSo, what I'm saying to you is that you've made a tremendous start in terms of this\nconference, but please don't be like the French and keep it at the level of talk. We want\nto see some firm action taken as a result of this conference and from speaking to Peter, I\nsee that he is also of the opinion that that is what needs to be done.\nI also want to say that if in Europe we don't tackle this question of racial inequality, the\nwhole issue of refugees, asylum seekers, immigration, if we don't tackle those issues\nseriously, we're storing up trouble for the future. People are not going to sit back and take\nwhatever is handed out to them forever. You might get away with it for one generation,\npossibly two, but certainly as more and more generations come on stream, as more and\nmore of the cultures of the old countries are forgotten and Black and other migrant people\ntake on board the culture of the Europeans, they're going to demand extra effort on their\npart to stop this inequality, so that you might as well do it now rather than later. The later\nyou leave it the more difficult it becomes. I think that over the next decade in Europe, the\nsecond biggest issue after unemployment is going to be the issue of race. The right-wing\nare getting more and more organised. They're migrating across the free borders of Europe\nand so on, and it's just a matter of time before there's a major serious race incident in one\nof these countries. We need to be vigilant and we need to take action.\nBut I also want to say to you that everything in life changes. People might think that",
            "13\n-\nDenmark today is almost the same as it was 100 years ago but there have been huge\nchanges. These changes have come about and people have become accustomed to them\nand worked with them. Similarly, there has to be a change in race. If there isn't a change\nin anything in life, that thing stagnates and it becomes useless after awhile, so everything\nmust change and we must not be afraid of change. We must meet change head on and we\nmust also try to control change.\nI'm not only talking about change in terms of Europe or this country, I'm talking about a\ngenuine new world order where people all over the world are able to trade on an equal\nbasis, where we cut out the huge debt that is owed by countries in the South to countries\nin the North, the huge amounts of money that keep pouring out of countries in the South\nof the world. I was speaking to the President of one of these countries in the South the\nother day and he said to me it is obvious that Europe is building a wall around itself, a fence\naround Europe. They are trying to stop people getting in and they're trying to impose\ntheir values and their views on the rest of the world. But, he had something to tell them.\nHe said, \"I come from a country where the rain-forest are the lungs of the earth and if\nEurope doesn't give us our just deserves, we'll cut down the damn rain-forset that converts\nCarbon Dioxide into Oxygen and we'll all die.\" He was so desperate, he said that is it. He\nalso said that they can put up as many barriers as they like. They can call for as many visas\nas they like. They can call for as many passports as they like, but they can't stop diseases\nfrom travelling around the world. Unless they do something to assist us in stamping out\ndiseases that are now becoming very prevalent in our countries, then they are in danger\nthemselves of importing those very viruses. The virus doesn't have to have a passport, the\nvirus doesn't have to have a visa. He was not threatening Europe, just putting the plain\nfacts on the table.\nWhen I talk about racial equality, I'm not only talking about equality for people living here,\nI'm talking about equality for people living in the South who are suffering from\nexploitation, from super-exploitation through exploitative commodity prices, of the Third\nWorld debt, of the interest payments that these people have to endure in order to keep\nEurope happy and healthy and booming. I'm talking about a more equal world where the\nenvironment is taken care of, not only in European countries, but countries in the rest of\nthe world, who also want to look after their environment, but because of the pressures on\ntheir economy have to cut down hard-wood timber in order to sell it to the West. This guy\nfrom South Africa said to me, \"I really like elephants, and I know that we shouldn't kill\nthem and so on, but if it comes to a choice between my family and the elephant, the\nelephant has to go.\" That's what he said, and I think that environmentalists and policy\nmakers in Europe should take on board the implications of what he said. If say, we want\na better world, we want a cleaner world, we want a more environmentally-friendly world\nthen we have to do something about the economies of the countries in the South. If we\ndo do something about these economies, then a lot of these problems will disappear,\nbecause nobody in their right mind would want to come to Europe in the middle of\nDecember, when they could be enjoying themselves somewhere in a sunny climate on a\nnice beach, in a free country, where they have a reasonable standard of living.\nI leave you with that thought. Thank you very much for listening to me."

            "AFRICA REPARATIONS MOVEMENT\n(UK)\n\"Reparations or Bust!\"\nInformation Sheet\nNo. 3\nBernie Grant MP.\nIn 1993, the Rt. Hon. Bernie Grant MP, Chair of the Africa Reparations Movement (UK),\nembarked upon a tour of cities around Britain, speaking on the issue of Reparations. The\nfollowing is an edited version of a speech he gave in Birmingham on the 11th April, which was\nattended by well over 300 people.\nI want to say to you that I have been going around the country speaking about this question of\nReparations. I have, over the past week been to Sheffield, I have spoken in Leeds, I have spoken in\nManchester and I am speaking in Birmingham tonight and next week I will be speaking in London -\nBrixton. That is the first half. During the second half of the tour I will be going to Liverpool, Leicester,\nNorth London and other places. The reason that we embarked on this speaking tour is because we\nwere concerned at the whole way in which the questions that I raised had been distorted by the press\nand the media, including the Black press. We were concerned especially about the way in which this\nissue was jumped on by those who should have known better, not least by the condemnation of\ncertain people within the so-called Anti-Racist Movement. So we thought - what better than to go\naround the Country, to meet with people of African origin face to face to explain to them what we are\nsaying, and to try and enlist the support of everyone. (APPLAUSE)\nNow I have to say, that so far, we have had absolute support and this is the one thing has made this\nsort of campaign different from every other. We have had support from young people, young people\nwho have come in off the street to give support. We have had support from women, and men, older\npeople and people from all walks of life. Most important however is that support from young people\nand I think that that is very, very significant.\nWe come to talk with you this evening and we know that Birmingham is an important place as far as\nthe United Kingdom is concerned, and we want to ensure that you play your full part in the\ndiscussions that are going on.\nI\nwant to start off by putting Reparations in it's proper context. I want to start off with the world\nsituation. I have seen over the past few years a deteriorating situation in the world, in which African\ncountries and Caribbean countries are in a state of crisis, and in a state of near collapse, in many\ncases. Almost every day we are hearing of another war that has started. We have heard of position\nin Angola, in Liberia, and in Sierra Leone - there is almost a war starting in Kenya, and look at what is\nhappening in Somalia. Now we see Burundi has exploded. Zaire has also got problems. It is quite\nclear that what is happening is whole new and different ball game throughout the world.",
            "2 Africa Reparations Movement (UK)\n\"Reparations or Bust.\"\nNow I am a Member of Parliament, and as well as representing constituents, I have special interests,\nlike every other MP. I make it my business to observe what is happening to Black people in Britain\nand around the world. I move around Britain, I go to the Caribbean and I go to Africa. I speak with\nleaders, I speak with Opposition Parties in particular. I have just come back recently from a trip to\nZimbabwe and Malawi where I spoke to people there. When you get to those countries you begin to\nsee the dependency that has arisen, the dependency on countries in the North. You begin to see the\nwhole way in which the Governments of Europe, and other Colonial countries have been\nmanipulating over the years to their own ends.\nIf you take the question of Third World debt - in 1990, three year ago, and the position has worsened,\nAfrica owed the Banks of the Northern Countries a total of 271 billion Pounds, 271 with nine noughts\nattached to it! Now they can work as hard as they like over the next few years but they will never be\nable to repay even the interest on the loan. We know that in the 1970s when money was loaned,\nthese countries were encouraged to do all sorts of things. They were encouraged to embark on\nfantastic projects and were lent money very low interest. When interest rates rose however these\ncountries found themselves in real trouble. They now have debts which they can never repay and\nare facing restrictions placed on them by the IMF which make life for ordinary people more and more\nimpossible.\nOne of the reasons that they are struggling of course is the whole way in which the commodity\nmarket is controlled by the people in the Northern Countries. They tell me in Kenya that the price that\nthey are getting for coffee today, is the same as the price that they were getting 15 and 20 years ago,\ndespite the fact that petrol prices have risen umpteen percent, despite the fact that fertilisers have\nrisen umpteen percent, and despite the fact that the retail prices of the goods we buy from these\ncountries have risen to by umpteen per cent. On top of that, these countries like Britain, France,\nGermany for example, are now growing crops that really they should not be growing. You go to\nSainsbury you buy rice from Italy. What right has Italy got to be producing rice, when rice can be\nproduced in Third World Countries? You go around the country, you see all these yellow fields, full of\nrape to make rapeseed oil. They have decided to substitute their own produce for the agricultural\nexports which African and Caribbean countries depended on for their survival. Another example is\nthe growing of sugar beet, displacing the need for sugar cane on which so many countries depended\nfor their economic survival. On top of that we have 500 multi-national companies who are going and\ncontrolling the whole world. So that we can begin to see the pressure that is beginning to emerge on\nthose countries in Africa and the Caribbean.\nNow if I can give you one last example an Economist from Jamaica told me the other day that out of\nevery dollar the Jamaican Government makes it pays back 85 cents in debt to these countries of the\nNorth. 85 cents of every dollar - which means there are only 15 cents left of every dollar that\nJamaica makes, to be spent on roads, schools and everything else. (APPLAUSE) And you know,\nJamaica is one of the middle range countries, Jamaica is not a poor country according to the United\nNations. So that you can understand that for those in the bottom range, there is little chance.\nNow as a Black person, and as an M.P., going around talking to people about what is happening, it\nhas become quite obvious to me that there is a need for Black people around the world to focus on\nthis situation. And I put it to you - some people are getting on well in Britain, thank you very much,\nbut what are we to do as African people in Britain, in Birmingham and elsewhere? What are we to\ndo? Are we to sit back and say \"Well I'm alright Jack, I am not going to worry about my black\nbrothers and sisters they can look after themselves\"? Is that the position that we want to take? Are\nwe going to turn our backs and say \"Well, I'm O.K. and the rest of them can go to hell\"? Well, that is\nnot my position, (APPLAUSE), and I believe that is not the position of the majority of people of African\norigin in this country.",
            "3 Africa Reparations Movement (UK)\n\"Reparations or Bust.\"\nWe have to begin to do something about the desperation of these countries, which is driving our\nblack brothers and sisters to take increasingly desperate steps. Already we have a situation where\npeople are trying to swim or go by boat from Morocco into Spain. They are being intercepted on the\nhigh seas by Spanish Coast Guards, and shot, and their bodies are being washed up on the beaches\nin Spain riddled with bullets. Or are we going to have a situation where people are going to be hiding\nin the trucks and lorries in order to escape the famine and the poverty that is taking place in Africa.\nNow I don't think that we can accept this, and we cannot sit back and do nothing.\nWhat has happened of course is that the New World Order has arrived. There used to be a Cold\nWar between the Soviet Union and the countries in the North, and in this Cold War there was never a\nshot fired in anger between them. What happened of course is that the Americans on the one hand\nhad their surrogates in Africa and around the world, the Soviet Union had their surrogates. Instead of\nthe Soviet Union and America fighting it out between them, they had the people in Somalia fighting it\nout, and the people in the North of Somalia fought the people in the South. That was carried on\nthroughout Africa and elsewhere, and untold quantities of arms were sold in the process.\nNow that the Cold War is over however, no-one is interested in Africa or the Caribbean any more\nbecause they have no strategic significance. Africa and the Caribbean are left to pick up the pieces.\nHaving sowed the seeds of division and conflict, they have walked out, leaving their hardware behind\nlike so many toys for people to play with. The Cold War was very hot in Africa, and will continue to be\nso for years to come. And then they tell us that we should stop fighting each other, that it is our own\nfault that Africa is scarred with scores of regional conflicts!\nAt the same time, a whole new scheme of things is shaping up in the world, in the form of giant new\ntrading blocs. We see the North American free trade area, being established right now, with America,\nCanada and Mexico. We also see the block in the East emerging, with China, Taiwan, Hong Kong,\nJapan, Malaysia and Indonesia and so on. Even the Australians and the Americans on the Pacific\nCoast of America are trying to get in on that economic block, which will probably be the richest block\nin the future. Then we've got the European Community, with the ex-Soviet countries, and the\nMediterranean countries queuing up to join.\nEventually we'll have a grossly enlarged Europe which will be a massive economic and political block\nin its own right. And you know, it will be the white countries they will allow to join Europe. They'll let\nin Czechoslovakia, Poland and so on, they'll let in Russia, and Georgia, but not Azerbaijan, or the\nplaces where non-whites live.\nIn the future, these three trading blocks will trade amongst themselves, and anybody else who is\noutside of those blocks is going to be squeezed to death. It's already happening, whether you like it or\nnot. The terms of trade are already being changed to the disadvantage of black countries, and\nalready aid money which used to go to those countries is being diverted to Eastern Europe.\nCountries in Africa, and countries in the Caribbean are going to have to get their act together, and we\nhave to get our act together on their behalf. This is the first deteriorating situation.\nThe second deteriorating situation is in Europe and we have seen in Europe the most shocking\nevents over the past few years. We have seen what has happened in Bosnia, where other European\ncountries have sat on their hands and allowed the Muslims to be ethnically cleansed. I tell you\nsomething you had better beware as African people about what this is all about. If people in Europe\n-",
            "F\n4 Africa Reparations Movement (UK)\n\"Reparations or Bust.\"\ncould sit back and see Muslims exterminated, who are White Muslims, who are no different looking\nfrom the Croatians and from the Serbs, you had better believe that if you are Black then you are\ngoing to not get the protection that you expect to get. This is a clear possibility, and I think you will\nagree with me that what has happened in Bosnia is an absolute and thorough disgrace. (APPLAUSE)\nWhat we have also seen in Europe, is a tightening of fortress Europe. We have seen that the\nFrench Government of Monsieur Baladour for example, is beginning to ring the changes. They are\nhave set up expulsion squads, they are going around rounding up people that think are illegal\nimmigrants, en masse. It is coming into Britain. We have a new Immigration and Asylum Bill on the\nStatute Books. We are having people in London picked up, Black youth ordinary African youth are\nbeing picked up by Police and being asked to prove that they are British on the street and to produce\ntheir birth certificates etc. We have seen the whole way in which the Immigration situation is\nchanging, and when the Inquiry into Joy Gardner's death comes out and let me say that I have little.\nfaith in any Inquiry carried out by the Police - but even that Inquiry, I understand, is going to show the\ndisgraceful way in which the Immigration Service is operating in this country.\nWe have seen an increase in racist attacks and racial harassment around Europe. We have seen an\nincrease in political parties on the far right, and they are gaining more and more electoral support.\nWe have seen the election of the British National Party candidate in Tower Hamlets, and I believe\nthat we are going to see more. And all these people who say, well the people in Tower Hamlets are\nmisguided, just misguided, I don't accept that. They are racist and that is the end of it and I am\nmaking no excuses for them. -(APPLAUSE) - They are racist (APPLAUSE) and that is part of the\nstruggle that we have to contend with.\nAnd the reason why these fascists are getting elected is that the major political parties have refused\nto do anything about racism. (APPLAUSE) We have seen all over Europe how political parties are\naccommodating racism, and we will not be surprised to see the same happen here too.\nNow we are at the crossroads I believe. We have got the situation in Britain where the fascists are\non the rise. When we came in the 1950s and 1960s we fought against the Teddy Boys, we fought\nagainst the Mods and the Rockers, we fought against the Skin Heads, and then the National Front.\nThen we thought - well that is it - we had a good sorting out and that was the end of it. And then we\ndecided that we needed to change the emphasis of the struggle in Britain and we needed to get\npeople into political positions. So we sent black people to be Councillors and out of that came 4 or 5\nM.P.s of African and Asian origin. We fought institutionalised racism, we had all sorts of affirmative\naction programmes and we had this programme, that programme and the other programme and the\nGovernment worked against us. The Government cut back a lot of the funding for Groups. They cut\nback the Urban Programme, Urban Aid - you name it - Inner City this, Inner City that they cut it all\nback and said that we had to sort ourselves out. In effect, we are in the position where we have to go\nback it seems and fight on the streets again.\nYou know there are some that say that we have to go back to the methods of the 1960s, and we\nhave to go back and confront this racist person and this right wing group and that fascist group. Well\nof course we have got to do it, but surely there must be something else that we can do. Why are we\nalways anti-this anti-that- we need to be pro-something for a change. (APPLAUSE) Yes, we have to\ntake part into the Anti-Racist struggle, yes we will do that but that cannot be the be-all and end-all of\nour existence here. We cannot say that is the pinnacle of our struggle and we have got a\nresponsibility to set a Black Agenda for the future. (APPLAUSE) Our agenda cannot simply be that\nwe are going and confronting the British National Party in Handsworth or in Tower Hamlets or\nanywhere else. We have to set a different agenda.",
            "5 Africa Reparations Movement (UK)\n\"Reparations or Bust.\"\nWhat I am saying to you, is that as a part of that agenda, we have to look to the worldwide situation\nconfronting people of African origin. We have to look at what is happening in Africa. We have to look\nfor example to April of next year when there will be ANC Government with Nelson Mandela as\nPresident in South Africa. We have other emerging countries in Africa, a lot of corrupt leadership in\nAfrica is beginning to fall by the wayside, people like Mobutu is on the run in Zaire. We have got all\nthose other criminals, like Hastings Banda is almost dead - thank God. We have to see where we are\ngoing for the future and I am saying, and I want anyone to get up and challenge this - that the future\nof Black people here depends on the future of Black people there, and around the world.\n(APPLAUSE).\nWhen people see us on T.V., they see people starving and they see people fighting, they see people.\nkilling each other, they walk down the street, and they see me or they see Linda Bellos, immediately\nthose images are transported into their mind and they think of black people in that way. So what are\nwe going to do about it? Well, I would respectfully suggest to you that one of things that we consider\nmost seriously is the whole question of Reparations and I want to turn to the question of Reparations\nright now.\nI am\nam saying that we need Reparations but I am not going to start from enslavement, I am going to\nstart from before that. I am going to say to you that Black people have a rich history and culture and\ntradition. (APPLAUSE) Our history has been distorted, so as to deny our achievements. For\nexample, we had people coming along and smashing the noses of the Sphinx, and the Pharaohs,\nbecause they knew that the nose identified the makers of those things as Black, Bantu, African\npeople so they smashed the noses.\n-\nWe had a civilisation long before anybody else. The Greeks copied the style of our palaces and other\narchitecture. The Greeks learnt mathematics from the Egyptians and the Egyptians were Black\npeople. The Arabs came later. (APPLAUSE) We practised sophisticated medicine in Africa centuries\nago. We had the knowledge to perform operations on people - open heart surgery where people\nwere able to sit and see themselves being operated on fully conscious and without pain. All that was\nhappening in Africa long before the white man set foot there.\nWe had the Benin Age when they were producing metals of all kinds bronze, silver, gold, iron, all\nthese things when people in this country were running around in caves covered in bearskin. (APP-\nLAUSE) That is the true history - those are the facts. (APPLAUSE) Our history has been wiped out,\nand re-written to suit the white world. As a matter of fact, the first human beings were Black and they\ncame from Africa. (APPLAUSE) The anthropologists now know that Black people and human life\nstarted in Africa. So all this nonsense about white Adam and Eve and all this kind of foolishness, you\nknow we have to take that with a pinch of salt. So that is where we start from.\nI repeat, we have a rich culture, tradition and civilisation that his been distorted. It was distorted for\none reason only, and that was to justify the exploitation of Africa by the white world. We needed to\nbe seen as sub-human, unintelligent drones without feeling or wit, otherwise the enslavement of\nmillions of black people by European countries could not have been rationalised. Slavery was of\ncourse an economic necessity for the British and for other European countries in an age of\nexpansionism and competition. Without it the Industrial Revolution could not have taken place. They\nneeded our raw materials, our cotton, our sugar, and other produce, but the production of these were\nlabour intensive.\nThere is no doubt that the economic development of Britain and Europe took place on the backs of\nenslaved and exploited black people in Africa and the Caribbean. Just read up on your black history.",
            "6 Africa Reparations Movement (UK)\n\"Reparations or Bust.\"\nUp to this day there are Companies who from the time of enslavement have been there and have\nbeen using our people for all of that time. When we talk about enslavement, don't let's just talk as\nthough its over and done with, its not. Let's talk about what happened. 26 million people died in\nmiddle passage.\nI went to Goree Island last year as a part of my going around the world. Goree Island is off Senegal\nand was one of the major ports for shipping slaves from the west coast of Africa. They showed us\nwhat happened. They took us to the slave houses. They showed us the ramps that they used to\nchase the slaves up and they showed us the sea which looked nice and calm but at that time it was\ncovered in blood because of those slaves who were rebellious were thrown into the sea and the\nsharks came and ate them. They showed us where they kept the women and showed us the trap\ndoors where the slavers would come in at night and take the women out and rape them and do all\nsorts of things to them. I saw big men crying in Goree Island when they saw what they had done to\nour people. I went to Elmina Castle in Ghana on the Cape Coast - I saw the slave castles, and\ndungeons which were used and smelt the sweat of the slaves still there- you can still smell it.\nSo anyone who tells me that it is a long time ago and we can forget it, I want to take them to Elmina\nCastle (APPLAUSE) and let them see it for themselves. (APPLAUSE) Go and see it for yourselves,\nand then you come back and tell me that we are not owed anything by these people! The historians\nand anthropologists have written about these things. It is all there if you want to find out what\nhappened. They used to send the soldiers into the villages and the soldiers in order to prove that\nthey killed people so that they could get paid, they would cut off the hands of the victims and they\nwould tie them together like bunches of bananas. They would emerge holding bunches of children's\nhands, women's hands and demonstrate them as a trophy. When they transported the slaves, that's\nwhen they took our best brains and brawn from Africa. The most prized person was a 15 year old\nnubile girl. They never took old people, and if you had bad teeth, or if you could not hear too well,\nthey left you behind. When they took slaves and transported them to the Caribbean they transported\nthem in one square foot of space for weeks on end.\nYou know you travel to the Caribbean today, you spend 8 hours on the jet plane, you get there - your\nneck is hurting you, your foot, your back in hurting you etc. These people spent weeks in one square\nfoot of space that they had to be transported in, packed together like sardines in a tin. You know they\nculled us, the bad ones that they just disposed of. If you were sick you were thrown overboard etc.\nThat is why 26 million people died in that middle passage. So we know what enslavement was all\nabout and then we had Colonisation and the super exploitation of our people and the super\nexploitation of raw materials and resources.\nWell, we are saying today that there are certain historic truths. There are certain things that\nhappened in the past and those things cannot be swept under the carpet any longer. We have not\nbeen in a position before in Britain where we have people like me, Members of Parliament who can\nraise matters in Parliament, who can get reported in the newspapers. Well it is about time that we put\nsome of these people to the test - because if you are a person of African origin, knowing the situation\nand you sit in the House of Commons and do nothing and do not raise these issues, you are doing a\nhistoric disservice to your people. (APPLAUSE)\nSo all those people who say \"Oh Bernie Grant is having a go again, foot in his mouth etc\", and all\nthese kinds of insults that people heap on me the more they heap them, the more I am going to talk.\nSo they had better believe it, I will not be silenced by anybody.\nNow we are saying that we want Reparations. What sort of Reparations do we need? Why do we",
            "7 Africa Reparations Movement (UK)\n\"Reparations or Bust.\"\nneed them? Are we entitled to it? People ask all these questions. Let me run through a few of them\nfor you.\nFirst of all, we are saying that we want an apology and an acknowledgement from the British\nGovernment because this is the country that was at the centre of the slave trade. (APPLAUSE) The\nBritish were the main shippers of slaves. (APPLAUSE) The old slave shipping routes went from Africa\nto Britain to the Americas. Even nowadays, if you want to get from America to Africa - you have to\ncome to Britain because the planes fly over the same slave routes. So we want first of all an\nacknowledgement and an apology for enslavement. (APPLAUSE) We want it from the very top\npeople, from the British Government and we want it from the Queen because she is the Head of\nState. We want it from her.\nWhy do we want it? Why do we need it? Well we need it because people are still suffering today as\na result of enslavement and colonisation. Racial discrimination grew out of them. As a matter of fact,\nracial discrimination came about in order for them to justify enslavement and colonisation. They had\nto justify the cruelty they inflicted on our people, to reconcile what they were doing with their\nconscience and their religion. They did it by making out we were uncivilised and inferior brutes, and\nthat they were doing us a favour by constantly subjugating us black people from Africa.\nAnd you know what they did of course, they sent along the soldiers first and then they sent along the\nmissionaries to upset our brains and to turn our brains to jelly. (APPLAUSE) I was talking to\nArchbishop Desmond Tutu, recently. He said to me \"when the missionaries came we had the land\nand they had the Bible, now we have the Bible and they have the damn land!\" (APPLAUSE)\nSo what they did was to enslave us and enslave our minds. They took away our culture, our history,\nour languages etc. It is no wonder that these days our young people do not know where they are\ngoing and get involved in all kinds of nonsense. Of course they have nothing to fall back on, they\ndon't know their roots, they don't know that they are people who are the descendants of people who\nwere the top people in the world - no one has told them this. Their history has been denied them. So\nthat we need this because we are today still suffering mentally from slavery here, and physically from\nslavery in the Third World. (APPLAUSE) So we need for that to be recognised.\nSome people say \"Oh well it was a long time ago, slavery was abolished 150 something years ago -\nreally we should live and let live and forget and all that old nonsense\". Other people have not\nforgiven them, or forgotten. Six million Jews were killed in the Holocaust in Germany. They get\nreparations. Germany writes out a cheque every year as reparations for what they did to Jewish\npeople during the War. The Japanese pay reparations to the Koreans for what they did during the\nSecond World War. Now the Korean women who were used as prostitutes etc. have put in a\nseparate claim, because they want reparations and restitution. The United Nations say that Saddam\nHussain has to pay reparations to the Kuwaitis for what he did during the war. Mr John Major\nhimself, the Prime Minister of Britain, recently came back from a tour of Japan in the summer, where\nhe went cap in hand to the Japanese Prime Minister, begging him to give reparations to Britain's\nPrisoners of War who were kept in the Prison Camps by the Japanese. At the end of the War they\ngave them £50 each or something, and that was not enough, so Major himself went to the Japanese\nto ask for more. Boris Yeltsin went to Japan the other day and apologised to them for taking some of\nthe Japanese Islands near to Russia, and they are negotiating giving them back.\nIn Australia, the Aboriginals are demanding an apology from the Australian Government for stealing\ntheir land. It seems like a matter of time before they get will get some compensation. The Enuit, who\nused to be called the Eskimos, in Alaska, get reparations because the Americans have sold their land\nand all the oil that is underneath the ground in Alaska. In Canada, and in America, the native",
            "3\n8 Africa Reparations Movement (UK)\nAmericans, are getting reparations because of the hurt that was done to them.\n\"Reparations or Bust.\"\nNobody has given us a penny in reparation for slavery, which was worse than all these put\ntogether. Not a single penny. As a matter of fact they added insult to injury in 1838, when they\nreleased the slaves in the Caribbean, they gave £20 million to the slave owners in compensation.\n(APPLAUSE) They gave us nothing! They gave the slave owners compensation for the release of\nthe slaves!\nThey talk about Wilberforce and other heroic people who abolished slavery - it is a load of rubbish -\nthe slaves freed themselves! (APPLAUSE) I come from Guyana, I know there was a slave named\nCutty who led his people and fought against the British. Now he was a real hero! My own family\nfought and they gave us a piece of land and they call it Hopetown, where all the rebellious slaves got\na bit of land from the British to keep us off their backs. And then there were heroes like Toussaint\nL'Overture, another rebel who fought like hell against subjugation. When they talk about how they set\nus free, you know, we ought to take that with a pinch of salt.\nSo we are entitled to reparations, and do not let anybody tell you that you are not entitled to it. We\nneed it people are still suffering from it and our countries are still suffering from Colonisation - so we\nneed it and we need it now.\nWhat forms should these reparations take? Well, this is a matter that we need to talk about, but I\nthink that one of the things that we have to insist on is that sacred, religious, historic artefacts are\nreturned to their countries of origin. (APPLAUSE) I made one suggestion at a meeting in Leeds.\nrecently, I told them we wanted some of the Crown Jewels back. Subsequently, the newspapers\nhave been asking me about this - I even had a call from Johannesburg to say that they want to know\nwhat is going on.\nWell let me tell you about this - I'm talking about some of the Crown Jewels, not all of them. I'm\ntalking in fact about the best of the Crown Jewels. The Stars of Africa - that is what they are called -\nthe Cullinan Diamonds. This diamond was found in 1905 by an African worker for the Premier Mining\nCompany. Of course history denies us his name, and we don't know anything about him. He gave it\nto the management. They found out that it was the biggest diamond that anybody bad ever seen in\nthe whole world at any time. In 1907, two years later, the Transvaal Government bought the diamond\nfor £150,000 and they wanted to give it to Edward VII as a present on his 66th birthday. The Liberal\nGovernment at the time said, they didn't think they should accept it, but Winston Churchill, who was\nthe Colonial Under Secretary at the time, persuaded them that they should have it.\nThey sent the diamond to a man in Amsterdam to cut it up because it was too big, and polish it up.\nWhen the man saw the diamond he fainted straight away because he had never seen anything like it.\nAnyhow, he cut it up into 9 major diamonds and into 96 smaller diamonds.\nThe 9 major diamonds are called the First Star of Africa, the Second Star of Africa, Third and Fourth\nStar of Africa all the way down to Ninth Star of Africa. Those diamonds were first of all given to\nEdward VII, and others were given to Queen Mary by the South African Ambassador in London, at\nMarlborough House and so on and so forth. The First Star of Africa is the biggest diamond in the\nworld. The Second Star of Africa is the third biggest diamond in the world. The First Star of Africa is\nin the sceptre of the Crown Jewels that the Queen has. Number Two is on the orb or some other part\nof the Crown Jewels, I believe. The rest of the nine are set in the Queen's personal Jewels, her\nbroaches, her rings, necklaces etc.",
            "9 Africa Reparations Movement (UK)\n\"Reparations or Bust.\"\nThe Nine Stars of Africa - I say we want them back. (APPLAUSE) We want them back in Africa.\n(APPLAUSE)\n-\nThe reason that we want them back - first of all is that the Transvaal Government was an illegal\ngovernment and they had no right to give it to anybody anyway, because it did not belong to them -\nthey stole it. Anything that is stolen, if you buy it or if you are given it as a present, you have to hand\nit back and they should be handed back to us.\nI am going to write to the Queen, because I know that she is a very reasonable woman. I will make\nthe suggestion to her that when in March of next of year South Africa has its first newly\ndemocratically elected Government with Nelson Mandela as President, she should make a symbolic.\ngesture. She should hand over the Stars of Africa to Nelson Mandela! (APPLAUSE)\nWhat else do we want by way of reparations? I think that we want a cancellation of Third World\ndebt. (APPLAUSE). The fact of the matter is that we don't owe them anything. They owe us.\n(APPLAUSE). -\nTime is running short tonight, but we also want substantial investment in the infrastructure of the\nAfrican and Caribbean countries, by way of reparations. We want clean new technology, because we\ndon't want to ruin the environment, as white people have done. We want proper training as well. I\nam saying that with this kind of agenda, Black people who want to go to those countries, either\npermanently or temporarily, should be assisted as part of a Reparations package. Our young people\nwho come out with degrees and so on will be able to go somewhere and to work, to build up these\ncountries, in Africa and the Caribbean. They need the opportunity, and Africa and the Caribbean\nneeds them. We need among other things to reverse the brain drain from these countries which has\noccurred in recent decades.\nSo that is what I am saying. I am saying that we need to work on developing this Reparations\nMovement. Now, we have been contacted by all sorts of people, I just want to mention how this thing\nhas taken off. We are getting calls, letters, everything as a result of this. We have been contacted by\nthe Ethiopian World Federation, The Nia Bingi Co-ordinating Committee, the Twelve Tribes of Israel,\nthe Nation of Islam, the All African Peoples' Liberation Front, the Pan African Movement, and large\nnumbers of individual people as well, who are excited by what they have heard, and want to play their\npart in making this movement grow. All of those people who for years have been arguing for\nreparations are coming under the umbrella of the Africa Reparations Movement, which is the\norganisation that we have set up.\nI was in Abuia the new capital of Nigeria in April of this year to attend a Conference sponsored by the\nOrganisation of African Unity on Reparations. The Abuia Conference was called to develop ideas\nworked out at a previous conference in Lagos in 1990, which I also attended. The Conference lasted\nabout a week. All the Governments of Africa were represented there, including the Arab States. The\nArabs acknowledge the part that they played as slave traders during slavery. And they said \"Yes, we\nhave to talk about it\". We talked about the fact that Africans themselves were involved - African\nChiefs, capturing people and selling them as slaves etc. We talked about that.\nWe had representatives from all over Africa and the Caribbean, from Cuba, from Jamaica, from\nBrazil, from all over the Diaspora. We agreed that we would each set up an Africa Reparations\nMovement in our country. When I got back I put out a call, and we had about a hundred people turn\nup to a meeting in the House of Commons. We elected an initial committee, and have been meeting",
            "10 Africa Reparations Movement (UK)\n\"Reparations or Bust.\"\nregularly to get this movement off the ground. So, we are trying - and over the next period we will\nwork together as people of African origin in order to sort ourselves out, both in this country and\naround the world.\nI want to return to the theme that I mentioned earlier - that I am not prepared to be part of the \"I'm\nAlright Jack' scenario. I am not involved in that and I suspect that you will see in this movement a\nchance to show that you don't want to be either. I think that we will get a lot of support.\nThis question of mental enslavement is very, very important. Bob Marley talked about it. That is a\nmajor issue. So Sisters and Brothers, we have been trying for years to get an issue that will unite all\npeople of African origin. I believe in this movement for Reparations we have the way forward. I\nbelieve that it begins to set the agenda, the Black agenda for the next ten years and for the\nmillennium. I believe that we have to do it historically, and I know that you will support us in this.\n(APPLAUSE)\nThank you very much. (APPLAUSE)"

            "The South East Region TUC-\nAnti Racist - Anti Fascist Broadsheet\n10p\nNo. 3\nA STEP FORWARD-\nFOUR BLACK LABOUR MPS\nAlong with many others in the trade union and labour movement the\nSERTUC's Race Working Party, welcomed the election to Parliament, last\nJune of four black Labour MPs. The following is an interview with Bernie\nGrant. We asked him what his election means for black people, how he\nintends to pursue his work, and what his views are about black workers\nand trade unions.\nPrior to the election there was a lot of\ndebate about the 'role' of black MPs. How\nis your 'role' developing and is it different\nfrom what you anticipated?\n-\nThere was a lot of debate about the role of black\nMPs and there still is. As there are no pre-\ncedents for our situation we run into an\nimmediate difficulty and that is black people's\nexpectations they do expect tremendous\nthings from us. We also of course have to cope\nwith the reality of the situation which is that\nthe Labour party is not in power and that is\na major problem. Even if the Labour party were\nin power, we are still outnumbered to such an\nextent that I believe that what we can actually\ncome up with is going to be very small indeed.\nPrimarily, I see our role as an enabling one,\nenabling people to fight for themselves. What\nwe need is for the black community\nthemselves to organise and make\ndemands on us and through us, make de-\nmands on the system. For instance, when\nwe take up issues like immigration inside Parlia-\nment we can take it up with the knowledge that\nthere are large numbers of black people out\nthere who are going to push us and support us.\nThat strengthens our case, so the role of an\nenabler is an important one.\nThe second role I see for us is developing\nlinks with black struggles throughout the world.\nFor example, the struggle of black people in\nAmerica. We have already been in touch with\nthe congressional black caucus, and we want\nto build links. If we can link and join together,\non issues like South Africa, we can influence\nboth our Parliaments and make a stronger case.\nWe are also developing links with black and\nthird world countries. The level of Third World\ndebt to the IMF presents many of those coun-\ntries with serious economic and political\nproblems.\nThis linking extends to individual countries\nand I am already doing a lot of work on the\nCaribbean because of my connections there. For\nexample since it has been privatised, British\nAirways, having already taken over Air Jamaica\nis now trying to run BWIA, which is the\nNational airline of Trinidad & Tobago. I am\nGrant interview\ntrying to do something about that. I would also\nlike to see Britain import more from the\nCaribbean. I know Paul Boetang wants to be\ninvolved with Africa, Diane Abbot with\nAmerica, and Keith Vaz wants to work on the\nMiddle and Far East, so this is a developing role.\nWe also of course have a role in educating\nthe Labour party and Labour members about\nracism and about their attitudes towards racism.\nTo sum up then, we are seeking to ensure\nthat black people are properly represented; that\nthey have the opportunity to speak for them-\nselves wherever possible, and we are trying to\neducate people in the Labour party about\nracism in its many forms.\nYou said that black people are writing to\nyou from all over the country. Is that\nbecause they feel that you represent their\ninterests?\nAnd what sort of issues dominate your\npost bag?\nPeople don't just write to me from all over the\ncountry about their problems, they also visit my\nsurgery. Mostly I can't deal with their cases and\nwouldn't because it would mean that I would\nbe doing other MP's work.\nThe sort of issues that dominate my post bag\nare the abortion bill, the NHS, ILEA, local gov-\nernment, dog licences, the gun lobby, that sort\nof thing. A lot of letters are congratulatory, about\ndifferent appearances I might have made on\ntelevision or about something I have said in the\nHouse and most of them are supportive. I do\nhowever get quite a lot of racist mail. Maybe\nyou would like to have a look at some examples\nof it. I have an enormous box which is kept in\nHaringey council. I must say, I don't get as much\nnow as an MP as I did when I was leader of\nthe Council. But there is still an awful lot. For\nexample, whenver I attack Thatcher in the\nHouse of Commons on South Africa, I get a lot\nof letters \"... How dare you speak to our Prime\nMinister like this, you're defiling Parliament,\nyou're a disgrace\". People actually print their\nnames and addresses!\nI do get a lot of enquiries about immigration.\nIn the past 3 months I have handled about 500\nTGWU Training\nNUPE\nSTAND UP\nFOR\nPATIENT\nCARE\nIF YO\nARE\nPoles WITH\nHO\ncases solely on that issue. Not many people\nwrite about racism, but they do write to me\nabout things that affect them like the cuts in\nlocal government.\nThe two issues that dominate my surgeries\nare immigration and housing. And they are two\nvery major issues, both of which I can do very\nlittle about. On immigration I can make a fuss,\nand I think I've got more done in immigration\nthan in housing. In housing it really is hopeless\nand it is a problem, because people come to\nme when they have been everywhere else. And\nthey come to me expecting something to hap-\npen, but I can't do much really because the\nresources are just not there.\nTo what extent do you think you\nrepresent all of your constituents?\nThere are no two ways about it. I clearly repre-\nsent all of my constituency. A significant pro-\nportion of the cases I deal with are for white\npeople, within the surgery or by letter, and I\nalways make sure that the representation I give\nthem is the same that I would give to anybody.\nBut, I find that the people who come to me\nmost are black people, and they are often the\n●Ethnic Monitoring\nMIKE COHEN MORNING STAR",
            "A STEP FORWARD From Page 1\nmost disadvantaged. As socialists, we must\nprioritise those who are most disadvant-\naged. So I give the same representation to\neverybody, but I seem to give more represen-\ntation to black people because they are more\nin number, they come to my surgery more, and\nsecondly because their cases are often more\nurgent. They certainly for example, have a lot\nmore housing problems. One of the reasons for\nthis is because in the past the Council gave\nblack people the worst housing in the Borough.\nSo there is a legacy of discrimination against\nblack people in terms of transfers, in terms of\nhomelessness and so on, which has to be dealt\nwith.\ntruthful and in doing so it will do two things,\nit will stop the racists on the shop floor who\nsay “Oh there are no problems here\" because\nit will be possible to demonstrate that there\nwere problems, and this is what happend as\na result of them.\nSecondly it will also give confidence to black\nmembers of trade unions that the unions are\ntaking the matter seriously. Unless this is done,\nunions will not be seen as properly addressing\nthe problems of racism.\nSo you see institutionalised racism as a\nbig obstacle, but what about trade union\nstructures?\nWhat are the obstacles blocking the\nadvance of black people in taking up\npositions in the Labour movement?\nOne of the major obstacles is institutionalised\nracism. Personal racism in some instances, and\na feeling by black people, that what they say.\nis not going to be taken seriously. For\ninstance, if you are dealing with people\nwho for hundreds of years were slaves\nor who have been made to feel that they\nwere 2nd class. If you want those people\nto become an integral part of your\norganisation, you have to do something\nabout it. You cannot expect them to just\ncome in and walk in the door like other\npeople who haven't had all those\npressures. Care and sensitivity is needed. The\nParty and the trade unions have to recognise\nthat they have been racist, sometimes overtly\nracist. A whole number of unions and the TUC\nhave, in the past, passed policies which have\ndiscriminated against black people.\nStructures are not a major problem, because\nblack people are accustomed to structures, there\nare trade unions in the Caribbean, there are\ntrade unions in Africa. Remember that\nBritain's Empire meant the export of\ntrade unionism as well, there are many\nex-colonies where trade unionism is very\nstrong.\nThe problem is confronting racism on the\nshop floor. I don't think the problem lies with\nblack people joining trade unions. Afro-carib-\nbean people join trade unions in a much higher\ndensity than their white sisters and brothers.\nWhere people work is also important; many\nblack people work in the public sector or in\ntransport, both of which are areas where there\nwas already a high degree of trade unionism.\nThis is where black people worked when they\nfirst came to this country. You don't get the same\nlevel of organisation amongst Indian workers\nand there is the problem of sweatshops we must\naddress. The contradiction here of course, is,\nthat the largest black trade union organisation\nThere was discrimination against these people,\nand it makes a nonsense of the slogan\n\"...workers of the world unite\"\nWhat sort of policies?\nFor example, some years ago, the TUC had a\npolicy that there should be no foreign nurses\nin Britain who needed to be trained. Now that\nis racist. There were a lot of nurses from the\nCaribbean, Hong Kong, the Phillipines, and\nother parts of the world who were prevented\nfrom coming to Britain to earn a living and\nacquire qualifications.\nin Britain is the Indian Workers Association\nwhich has 18,000 members.\nThere was discrimination against these\npeople, and it makes a nonsense of the slogan\n\"... Workers of the world Unite\". In the past,\nunions have passed resolutions at their\nnational conferences which I consider\nwere racist. In the 1950s & 60s, in Birming-\nham and in the Midlands, we can find much\nevidence of overt racism by trade unionists\nagainst black workers. At one time there were\nno black bus drivers or bus conductors. These\nthings came from the unions themselves. What\nwe are saying as black people is that the unions\nneed to expunge their racism, to recognise and\nacknowledge it, and say yes, we were guilty of\ncarrying out racist policies in the past and we\nrecognise that.\nWHITES\nPASS RIGHT\nTHROUGH\nESPECIALLY\nSOUTH\nAFRICANS.\nHAVE A NICE\nDAY\nCOME\nAGAIN SOON\nIMMIGRATION\nWHITES\nBLA\nget those black trade unionists into the Party\nand working actively within it.\nWhy is it that the public sector unions like\nNUPE and NALGO have a much better\nrecord in their fight against racism?\nWhen black people first came here in great\nnumbers they went into the public sector, into\ntransport, hospitals, some local government\nposts. These were then the low paid jobs that\nwhite people did not want to do. So we have\na concentration of black people in low paid\nindustries in the public sector and that's where\nthey've had more of a voice in their unions.\nThere are industries in the private sector which\noperate a father-son type of relationship and it\nhas been virtually impossible in the past to get.\nblack people into those industries. So if they're\nnot in those industries they won't be in the\nunions which organise there.\nUnions are particularly bad in terms of the\nnumbers of black full-time officers. When I was\na full-time official for NUPE, there were very\nfew black full-timers around and I think that\nis still the case. In some industries you just don't\nget black people in those positions. For some\nreason, blacks get so far, they may\nbecome a convenor, but they never seem\nto become a full-time official. This is\nsomething that needs to be looked at.\nNow I think that unless you start from that\npoint and sort of cleanse the past, then you're\nnot really going to convince black people that\nyou are serious. It is important for us to be\nShould we have black sections in the\ntrade union movement?\nAs far as NUPE is concerned they didn't just\ndevelop policies out of the goodness of their\nheart-they were forced by their members to\ndo this. I remember when I was a full-time\nofficer, we pushed issues, we pushed to have\na race advisory committee in London, we\npushed in other areas. The black members took\nup the issues and pushed NUPE into taking\npositions like supporting black sections in the\nearly days, it was pressure from the member-\nship. We also haven't had a history of racism\nin NUPE, there may have been the odd branch\nsecretary where we had problems in the past,\nbut we have not had the same amount of\nconcentrated racism as there have been in other\nunions.\nI think that the TUC actually agreed that there\nshould be black sections. But there is a big con-\ntradiction here, because whilst the TUC agrees\non black caucuses within the trade unions, they\ndon't feel the same way about having them in\nthe Labour party. Those people who voted for\nthe TUC to have black sections appear to have\nvoted against them in the Labour party. There\nare more black activists in the unions than there\nare in the Labour party. When you attend\nLabour party conference you see a fair amount\nof black people, but they don't come from the\ntrade union delegations, they come from the\nconstituency parties. What we need to do is to\nSo we still have a long way to go? But the\nsituation is not all bad. You have been\ninvolved in the Labour and trade union\nmovement now for about 15 years, have\nyou seen change? We are moving aren't\nwe?\nI think that certainly within the public sector\nthere have been tremendous moves, especially\nwithin local authorities. There is a recognition\nfrom people that we need to combat racism and\nthe sort of racism I used to encounter when I\nwas a full-time official would not now be",

I think in\nterms of membership, the unions have more\npower than they should have within the party.\nI don't see why a trade union can affiliate half\na million members at £1.20 or whatever it is,\nand yet an ordinary member has to pay £7 or\n£8 a year. If a trade union wants to affiliate\n100,000 members, then it should pay the\nsame membership fee as the ordinary\nparty member pays, then the block vote\nwould be alright. But I don't think you\ncan pay less and have more rights. So this\nis an area I want to see sorted out and I believe\nour relationship would be a lot more healthy\nfor it. Many constituency activists get very upset\nthat trade unionists can use the block vote to\npass policies which have not even been through\ntheir own union policy making bodies. I would\nlike to see trade unions debating some of these\npolitical issues more seriously, perhaps they can\nhave a special political conference to deal with\nthe party's issues.\nI cannot say what the position is in the private\nsector because that is not where my experience\nlies. There have been tremendous changes in\nthe public sector, when I worked in Newham,\nfor example, the unions agreed to ethnic moni-\ntoring and that was a tremendous leap forward.\nI know this is now common place up and down\nthe country, but one of the main reasons for\nthis has been because the employers, mainly\nLabour councils have taken a very firm stand\non this issue and people have fallen into line.\nThe same cannot be said for the private sector,\nalthough I believe at Fords and a few other com-\npanies equal opportunity policies are being pur-\nsued, but I do not see the same level of commit-\nment from the unions.\nOne of the areas I do know about, contracts\ncompliance, demonstrates clearly the problems\nwe have had with the private sector in trying\nto get compliance with equal opportunities\npolicies. Ethnic monitoring must be one of\nour most important demands. Because\nuntil you can quantify the scale of the\nproblem you cannot really begin to do\nanything about it. Most unions have no\nidea about their ethnic minority\nmembership, either its size or its needs.\nAt the same time, I want to see a closer\nrelationship with the Labour party and\nthe unions. It is important to have large\nblocks of people, like trade unionists, who\nare able to fight collectively against the\ndomination of the multi-national com-\npanies and against the enormous power\nand influence of big business. I want to\nsee a better balance. The Labour party\nis the party of the unions, and they have\nto be closer, but that closeness should be\nas democratic as possible.\nThe Labour party is emarking on major\npolicy review at the moment, what would\nyou like to see coming out of it for trade\nunionists and what will you be pushing\nfor?\nWe need to give the unions back their indepen-\ndence and the Labour party has got to get its\nindustrial relations policy right. So compulsory\nlaws in terms of the way trade unions operate\nmust go. This is probably the most important\nand major area.\nImmigration in the main has not been\nregarded as a trade union issue, although\nsome unions have become heavily in-\nvolved in anti-deportation campaigns.\nHow do you see this developing?\nWhilst they should be supported anti-deport-\nation campaigns are by their very nature de-\nfensive campaigns. We need to go on to the\noffensive against Thatcherism and the immi-\ngration issue.\nSecondly we must sort out the question of\nthe economy and the pay situation. We have\nto address the problem of low pay, we have to\neliminate it. I believe in a national minimum\nwage, I think this is a must. The Health & Safety\nInspectorate needs resources and legislation to\nensure that people are working and living in\na healthy and safe environment.\nThe relationship between the party and the\nThe relationship between\nthe Labour Party and the\nTU's needs clarification\nBLACK\nWORKERS\nEthnic monitoring:\nthe TUC's Black Workers\nCharter says:\n\"Ethnic monitoring is increasingly being\naccepted as an essential tool in combating\nracism in employment and in trade unions. In\norder to promote a programme of positive\naction to elimiate racial discrimination, it is\nnecessary to know how many black people are\nemployed in an organisation, or are members\nof a union, and at what level they operate. Once\nthis information has been established it can be\nused to support the case for further steps\nincluding positive action measures.\nFor these reasons the TUC supports ethnic\nmonitoring. However, it recognises that it has\nto be carried out with proper care and data\nprotection, as with other information about\nemployees. A full explanation of the reasons for\nmonitoring must be given to all employees\ntogether with an assurance that any information\ngained will be treated in confidence and used\nonly for the good and not to the detriment of\nthe workforce, or the membership.\"\nWhy, for example, don't we ask for a pro-\nsettlers campaign? Changing the terminology\nwould make a difference. Lets have something\npositive. We're not just about defending people,\nwe must come forward with new ideas.\nImmigration as an issue has been kicking\naround the Labour movement for a very\nlong time, and it has never been properly\ndiscussed, either in the Labour party or\nin the unions. We have unions with a very\nreactionary position with regard to immigration\nand that needs to be thrashed out. But it is\nextremely difficult to get people to come to a\nforum to discuss it. Somehow we have to find\na way of getting it on to the agenda, so that we\ncan discuss it in our unions, otherwise, the only\nplace people can get their information from will\nbe from the gutter press, will be from the Sun,\nwill be from the television. We have a duty to\nredress that balance by discussing it in our\norganisations. So we need a proper debate on\nimmigration within the trade union movement\nand if you can get one going within SERTUC\nthat will be in my view a big step forward.\nThe South East Region of the TUC has over\nthe last four years given priority to its Anti-Racist\nwork. Its Race Working Party decided at the end\nof last year to examine the extent to which its\naffiliates complied with TUC policy on ethnic\nmonitoring. The results were extremely\ndisappointing — but they do indicate that some\nUnions are making a start, are taking the lead.\nUnions who do monitor ethnic origin of\nmembership:\n-\nNo union which responsed had initiated a\nregular system of ethnic monitoring.\nUnions who have carried out partial\nmonitoring or pilot exercises on a limited\nscale:\nFire Brigades Union\nNational Union of Journalists (asks for ethnic\norigin of all new members)\nNational Union of Public Employees (pilot\nexercise being set up in one division)\nTASS (pilot exercise in one region)\nUnions who are considering setting up\nmonitoring system:\nConfederation of Health Service Employees\nNational and Local Government Officers'\nAssociation (a decision is likely to be taken at\nthe union's conference this year)\nUnions who have not monitored and\nseem unlikely to do so in the near future:\nElectrical Power Engineers' Association (EMA)\nGeneral, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied\nTrades Union\nNational Graphical Association\nNational Union of Tailors and Garment Workers\nTransport and General Workers' Union\nUnion of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers\nIt should be noted that a number of major\naffiliates did not respond to the circular.\n●The Charter is available from SERTUC\nOffice, Congress House.",
            "Learning Lessons - Raising Awareness\nSince 1985 the Southern Region of the TGWU Region No2 have run a series of Racism awareness courses\nfor union members. We asked Bob Purkiss, the Regional Education Officer what his experiences of these\ncourses had been, what lessons had been learned and how he hoped to progress this work in the future.\nHe and Carol Rowe sent us the following:\n―\nThe initial one-day Race Relations seminar was\nnot overwhelmingly supported just a couple\nof shop stewards participated. This highlighted\nthe low priority which active trade unionists\nplaced upon this subject. However, it was not\na wasted day, as one of the stewards said:\n\"It made me question whether I accept\nethnic minorities as equals as honestly\nas I would believe. After only a day view-\ning the situation from an entirely differ-\nent angle. I have questioned myself\ndeeply upon this topic. It's been a good\nexperience\".\nThe lack of interest for this seminar was also\ndue to the fact that many people in this region\ndo not see race as an issue. Many of our com-\nmunities do not have any black residents, there-\nfore \"it doesn't affect them\".\nYet Portsmouth is a prime example of how\nincorrect this attitude is. There are very few\nblack people who either live or work within the\nCity. But it is one of the most racist areas on\nthe south coast. This has a great deal to do with\nthe \"nationalistic\" tradition of the Royal Navy\ndockyard. One of the Portsmouth stewards put\nit this way:\n\"This was the first chance I have had to mix\nwith people of different races - socially and\nformally. Where I live and work there are no\ncoloured people. However, there is a fair\namount of discrimination against blacks\".\nAlso, because of the reluctance of some emp-\nloyers to allow paid release for such courses,\nwe decided to run a pilot weekend course. We\nhoped this would also encourage ordinary\nmembers to participate rather than exclusively\nshop stewards and branch officials. The other\ninteresting thing was that this pilot course was\nsplit 50-50 between black and white partici-\npants, with a black male tutor and female white\ntutor. This added a great deal to the subsequent\nlevel of discussion. As one student said:\n\"I experienced at times a great sadness when\nI was made aware first hand, by course mem-\nbers of the problems they had encountered not\nonly at work but in their normal daily lives. You\nwere right in bringing home these points to\nsomeone as ignorant as myself on the subject\nof racism\".\nIn subsequent courses we have endeavoured\nto maintain this balance, although the most re-\ncent course had all white participants. Because\nof this we felt some of the discussions were not\nas sharp as previously. In spite of this it is\nencouraging to see that more of our white mem-\nbers now recognise racism as an important\nissue, and wish to be informed on how to deal\nwith it. Also because we \"link\" racism to dis-\ncrimination in any form it is easy to bring many\neveryday problems into context eg. women,\nyouth, disabled, and so on.\nWhen the course objectives are set out we\nstress to our students how important it is to be\ncompletely honest with each other. Not to give\nthe \"right\" answers, but to speak how they feel\nand think. Without this level of honesty the\nwhole course is pointless. With very few ex-\nceptions, this approach has worked extremely\nwell.\nOne area which always initiates a great deal\nof discussion and afterwards greater awareness,\nis the \"Myth or Reality\" session. For this we\nuse a video, followed by group discussions and\nreport backs. Students see something of English\nhistory which they've never been exposed to\nbefore. We also look at everyday statemates\nsuch as \"There are too many blacks in the\ncountry\", \"Black people take our jobs\", \"Over-\ncrowding in housing and hospitals is due to\nblack people\".\nWe also introduce them to the extent of media\nbias, which elicit responses such as:\n\"It opened my eyes to how misinformed I\nwas. I believed the statements made by the\nmedia, not doubting the authenticity or\ncorrectness of the facts.\"\n-\n... \"We think it's possibly the way we've\nbeen brought up and media brain-washing\".\nAn important element is contained in the\nfinal session \"Future Action - The Way\nForward\". The first hurdle is to make trade\nunionists conscious of racism, both within\nsociety generally, and in particular at the work-\nplace. So we ask our students to look, upon\ntheir return to work, at the inequality in the\nrange of jobs done by blackworkers, which pro-\nvide training and chances of promotion, the\nattitude of management to racial inequality and\nso on. Another area which needs to be exam-\nined is within our own organisations. As one\nbranch secretary summed up:\n\"Trade unions need to look carefully at\ntheir policies. Our objective is to\npersuade them not only to argue with\ntheir employers for equality in the work-\nplace, but also to adopt policies which\nwill ensure full representation and parti-\ncipation for their black members within\ntheir branches\".\nSome who have been on Racism Awareness\ncourses have gone back and have held informal\ndiscussions with their members on the subject.\nOthers have held shop stewards meetings,\nwhilst others have got their branch to invite out-\nside speakers to branch meetings. Some have\nfound that they are very aware of racist jokes\nand remarks which would have passed un-\nnoticed before. Others have explained the racist\nelements in these jokes to their children, in an\neffort to stop this type of brainwashing.\nAt times it all seems to be so painfully\nslow. On looking back to our first one-day\nseminar of two people, to today's over-\nsubscribed two-day courses, we can see\nhow much progress has been made.

As his handwritten speech notes in the archive show, Bernie had researched the speech and discovered a link between Burns and the exploitation of enslaved Africans in Jamaica, hitherto not widely appreciated.\nQuotes from Burns are attached at the end of the speech notes, and inserted at numbered points in the speech. As well as making some contemporary political points about the Labour Party under Tony Blair, Grant showed how Burns prospective forced departure from his beloved Scotland, led him to identify with the plight of enslaved Africans, forcibly transported across a perilous ocean.\nHis speech ended with a rousing chorus of “Ye Banks and Braes”. (He was known to enjoy a good sing song!)\n\nThe programme for the Milngarvie Burns supper is also included in the collection, as are local press cuttings which record the occasion.\nThe West Lothian event is fondly recalled at some length by Tam Dalyell in his autobiography.\nFrom Tam Dalyell,The Importance of Being Awkward: the autobiography of Tam Dalyell\nBernie’s links with Scotland were several, and he often pointed out the origins of his own name lay in theScottish plantation owners under slaveryin his native Guyana. He went to Herriot Watt University where he studied Mining Engineering as a young man, and later visited regularly as a Member of Parliament. The attached photo from the archive was taken on a visit to the Western Isles in Stornaway. Also in the archive are details of his attempts to return artefacts in Scottish museums looted from Africa.\n\nAt his funeral at Alexandra Palace in 2000, the procession was led by a Highland piper in recognition of his connections and love of Scotland.\n\n\nI invited Grant and he was outstanding. His theme was Burns and slavery. The chairman, Allister Mackie, a considerable and erudite Burns scholar and enthusiast, acknowledged that everything Grant said about Burns – who had very nearly gone to Jamaica and dabbled in the slave trade – was true. Grant held the audience in the palm of his hand and concluded, ‘My name is Grant. Some of you are probably called Grant.’ Indeed they were. ‘The difference between us is that your grandfathers were slave owners and my grandfather and great-grandfather were slaves in the sugar plantations, along the Demerara River in British Guyana. You see there was a system by which the slave owner bestowed his own name on the slave.’ The Bathgate audience gulped. ‘And,’ continued Bernie Grant. ‘My mother’s maiden name was Blair, where the same system applied.’ The audience, mostly dyed-in-the-wool socialists who were not enamoured by New Labour policies and Tony Blair, chuckled with delight and exploded with merriment when Grant put his hand to his beard and said, dead-pan, ‘Come to think of it, I should get a DNA test done to see what relation I am to the Prime Minister!’From Tam Dalyell,The Importance of Being Awkward: the autobiography of Tam Dalyell"

Over 35 years, he was at the forefront of a furious dialogue about race in British society as a trades unionist and civil rights activist, as the first ever Black Leader of a local authority in Europe in Haringey, North London, as an outspoken Black Member of Parliament, and as an international campaigner.\nA record of these crucial years is contained within Bernie’s papers, in books and magazines, memorabilia, correspondence, audio and video material and hundreds of photographs of meetings and demonstrations. Together they tell not only his story, but of the struggles of an entire generation of black and minority ethnic citizens who arrived in Britain in the post war period.\nIn partnership with the Heritage Lottery Fund and Middlesex University the Bernie Grant Trust appointed a professional archivist to preserve, catalogue and make accessible, a permanent collection to be held at Middlesex University and on the web.\nIn addition to this a Guide to the Collection is available for schools and the community at large. Future plans include seeking further funding for outreach work, establishing a mobile exhibition to travel to schools and community centres throughout the country. We want to work in partnership with other archives and museums to develop joint exhibitions, both permanent and temporary. We wish to create not just a static physical archive, but a live, interactive experience that can and will be enjoyed by a wide range of people.\nBernie had a strong sense of his heritage, and strived in his lifetime to ensure that minority ethnic communities were in touch with their history. He was adamant that the present could not be understood without honesty about the past. He was especially aware that the achievements and experiences of Black communities had too often been “written out” of history. It is fitting therefore that his own life and times are properly recorded, and the collection provides a rich and unique resource for future generations who seek to understand a key period in the making of the multi-racial Britain.\nIn 2003, in partnership with the Heritage Lottery Fund and Middlesex University the Bernie Grant Trust appointed a professional archivist to preserve, catalogue and make accessible, a permanent collection to be held at Middlesex University and on the web. In 2010, with Middlesex University changing shape, the collection has found a new home at the prestigious Bishopsgate Institute in heart of the City of London, along with the archives of other labour movements and free thinkers of their day.\nThe Bernie Grant Trust is a charity, and relies on donations to maintain and preserve its unique archive, and to run social and educational projects using the collection.

Bernie Grant had\nbeen the Labour leader\nof Haringey Council\nduring the politically\nturbulent late 1980s, and\nI went on to become the\nMember of Parliament\nfor Tottenham, a multi-\ncultural area of north\nLondon. The 4000\npeople who attended\nthe service at Alexandra\nPalace made this one of\nthe largest ever public\ntributes at a funeral of a\nblack person in Britain.\nBernie Grant gained\na reputation for being\ncontroversial because\nhe tackled some of the\nmost difficult issues\nthat affected the lives of\npeople in this country\nBernie Grant aged 6 years at Ituni, Guyana\npage 4\nand overseas. He was\na committed anti-racist\nactivist who campaigned\nagainst apartheid South\nAfrica, against the\nvictimisation of black\npeople by the police\nin Britain and against\nracism in health services\nand other public and\nprivate institutions.\nAs one of the most\noutspoken black political\nleaders in recent times,\ncampaigning for racial\nand social justice for\nover three decades,\nBernie Grant made\nan indelible impact on\nthe public, through the\nattacks on him in the\nmedia and through his\nspeeches at meetings.\nIn making the transition\nfrom left wing activist\nto Parliamentary office,\nthe story of his life\nmirrors the changes that\nthe country was going\nthrough, as it attempted\nto come to terms with\nbecoming a multi-racial\nsociety after decades of\nbeing an imperial power.\nBorn into a family of\neducationalists on\n17 February 1944 in\nGeorgetown, Guyana,\nBernie Grant was the\nsecond of five children.\nA popular, sociable child\nat primary school, he\nwon a scholarship to\nSt Stanislaus College, a\nJesuit boys' secondary\nschool. Although he\npassed his O Levels\nwith flying colours,\nhe left school a year\nlater because he wasn't\nallowed to study his\npreferred subjects. He\nthen worked for two\nyears as a laboratory\nanalyst before he left\nfor England to join his\nfamily.\nBernie Grant's first job\non arrival in London\nwas railway clerk,\nbefore studying at\nTottenham Technical\nCollege in 1965-67.\nAfter leaving college,\nBernie Grant went to\nstudy for a degree in\nMining Engineering at\nHeriot-Watt University\nin Edinburgh. He left\nthe University in 1969\nwithout completing his\ndegree in protest at the\ndiscrimination against\nHARINGEY COUNCIL\nFENDING YOUR SERVIC\nHAR\nRE\nBernie celebrates being elected as leader of Haringey Council\nblack students that\nprevented them from\nparticipating in work\nexperience in apartheid\nSouth Africa.\nFor the next nine\nyears, he worked\nas an international\ntelephonist, becoming\na shop steward in the\nUnion of Post Office\nWorkers, and fighting\nfor the rights of fellow\nworkers. By 1978 he\nbecame a full time Area\nOfficer for what was\nthen the National Union\nof Public Employees\n(NUPE), responsible for\nits local authority and\nhealth workers. Bernie\nGrant then founded the\nBlack Trade Unionists\nSolidarity Movement,\nand by 1983 worked for\nit full time.\nHe joined the Tottenham\nLabour Party in 1975,\nand was elected a\ncouncillor for the\nLondon Borough of\nHaringey in 1978. He\nhelped to found a\nnational organisation\nfor Black and Asian\ncouncillors, and was\na prime mover in the\nfight for Black Sections\nin the Labour Party.\nNot everyone accepted\nBlack Sections, as some\nclaimed that they were\ndivisive. However, Bernie\nGrant argued that it was\nnecessary to set them\nup as the Labour Party\nhad failed to listen to\nits black members and\nwas not doing enough\nto promote black\npage 5",

Positive\naction for lesbian\nand gay people, for\nwomen, for black and\nminority communities,\nwere hallmarks of\nhis leadership, as was\nhis stance against the\nGovernment attempts\nto curb the spending\npowers of deprived\ninner city Councils.\nIn the early to mid\n1980s, England was\nunsettled by civil unrest\nacross the country. In\nLiverpool, Birmingham,\nand London young\npeople rioted. Although\nfrequently described as\n'race riots' the people\ninvolved were often\nfrom those black and\nwhite communities\nwho felt that they their\nvoices were not being\nheard by politicians\nand officials. Violent\ndisturbances took\nplace on Haringey's\nBroadwater Farm Estate\nin 1985 after police\nraided the home of\nCynthia Jarrett who\ncollapsed and died in\nthe unrest, a policeman\nwas murdered and\nBernie Grant quickly\nrose to national\nprominence, as he\ndefended the youths\nwho had rioted against\npolice harassment.\nBernie Grant's\nremarks about the\nriots were consistently\nmisrepresented in\nnewspapers, and the\nBritish tabloid press in\nparticular singled him\nout as a figure of hate.\nBut in spite of a negative\ncampaign of crude\nracial stereotyping, the\nTottenham electorate\nvoted him into\nParliament in 1987, as\none of the first black\nMPs in modern times.\nFamously, ever conscious\nof his ancestral roots, he\nentered his first State\nOpening of Parliament\nin African clothing\nsomething he continued\nto do throughout his\ncareer, attracting outrage\nfrom some quarters\n- but huge respect from\nothers.\nBernie Grant had built\nup credibility with a\nrange of communities\nwho felt excluded from\npolitics and from society\nin general.

He\nbrought to Parliament\na wealth of political\nexperience, and quickly\nset about using his new\nstatus to convene a wide\nvariety of events and\norganisations to take\nthose issues forward\nlocally, nationally and\nBernie outside parliament\ninternationally.

In\n1990 he accompanied\nthe African-American\nformer presidential\ncandidate, Reverend\nJesse Jackson to South\nAfrica, greeting Nelson\nMandela on the day\npage 8\nof his release after 22\nyears imprisonment.\nLater on, Bernie\nGrant established an\ninformation technology\ncentre amid the\nimpoverished townships\nin the Free State, South\nAfrica, which is named\nafter him.\nNoting the problems\nthat black people\nencountered when\ntravelling around Europe,\nBernie Grant founded\nthe Standing Conference\non Racism in Europe in\n1990. Another important\ninitiative that he helped\nto establish was the\nAfrica Reparations\nMovement (ARM) in\nBritain in 1993. As\nchair of ARM, he was\nkeenly aware of the\nimportance of history\nand heritage for African\ndiaspora peoples:\n'Only if we understand\nour past can we as\nBlack People move\nforward in the future.\nWe must demand\ncompensation for the\nbiggest crime in history\n-\n– the colonization and\nenslavement of our\npeople.'\nThe Global Trade\nCentre (founded 1995)\nand Caribbean Links\nwere both concerned\nwith ensuring that\nblack communities in\nBritain maintained and\ndeveloped economic\nand cultural ties in\nthe developing world.\nBuilding on his desire\nto develop pride in\ntheir locality through\nregenerating the area,\nBernie Grant's last big\nbattle was to work\ntowards establishing a\ndedicated black arts and\ncultural facility in his\nTottenham constituency.\nThis major building\nproject which has\nbeen granted £12m\nis now to be named\nThe Bernie Grant Arts\nCentre.\nCARIBBEAN\nOUT\nOF\nMANY.\nLINKS\nWE ARE\nCaribbean Links, co-founded\nby Bernie Grant, recognized\nthe links between history,\nculture and identity.\nFor 13 years, he\nGrant's campaigning\nenergies were also\ndirected towards\nissues as diverse as\nthe incidence of TB,\npensioner's rights,\nprostitution and its\nnegative impact on\nTottenham residents, and\ndisabled parking permits.\nAway from the public\ngaze he was renowned\nfor his empathy with the\nmany thousands who\napproached him with\ntheir personal difficulties.\nQueues at his MP's\nadvice surgery were\nlegendary, as was his\npassionate advocacy for\nvictims of injustice.\nused the floor of the\nHouse of Commons\nto considerable\neffect, to further his\ncampaigns against\nracist policing methods,\ndeaths in custody, and\napartheid.

With the advent of\nthe Labour Government\nin 1997, he became\nChair of the All Party\nGroup on Race and\nCommunity, and of the\nBritish Caribbean Group.\nIn addition, he was\nappointed as member of\nthe Select Committee\non International\nDevelopment,\ncontinuing to argue\nfor the elimination\nof overseas debt for\npoor nations, and for\nthe recognition of the\nongoing consequences\nof the past injustices of\ncolonialism and slavery.\nAlthough he is best\nknown for his work in\nthe field of racial justice\nespecially in relation\nto the police, Bernie\nBernie Grant articulated\nthe concerns of his\ncommunity at the\nhighest levels of\nGovernment, and\nwas regarded as\nthe authentic voice\nof Britain's ethnic\nminorities.

Archives may\nbe in various formats,\nincluding paper files,\nparchment documents,\nbound volumes, maps,\nplans, audio and\nvideo recordings and\nphotographs. They\nmay be of any date,\nfrom early centuries\nup to the present day.\nArchives are retained\nby their creators, or in\nrecord offices and other\nrepositories, because of\ntheir abiding interest for\nresearchers - interest\nwhich their original\ncreators might never\nhave expected.\"\nPublic Records Office,\nNational Archives,\nKew, Greater London\nLooking in the Archives\nThe BGA is available for\nvisits on Mondays and\nTuesdays, from 9am to\n5pm and on Wednesdays\n1pm to 5pm. You must\nmake an appointment\nbefore you visit the\narchive as space is\nrestricted.\nArchives often have\nobjects that are delicate\nand need to be handled\nwith care. The papers\nor photographs may\nwell be unique and if\neverybody is to be able\nto gain knowledge from\nthem, they need to be\nlooked after. There may\neven be some parts\nof an archive that you\ncannot look at because\nthe documents are too\ndelicate or because\nthere is sensitive\nmaterial in it. Access to\nrestricted files may be\npossible under certain\nconditions and you will\nneed to consult with the\narchivist before you visit\nregarding permission.\nIf there is anything\nlikely to cause offence\nor distress such as\nexamples of hate mail -\nthe archivist should alert\nyou to this possibility.\n-\nYou will not be allowed\nto eat or drink where\nthe documents are\nstored, and you may be\nasked to wear cotton\ngloves when handling\ndocuments or other\nobjects, to prevent\ndamage or staining.\nOften, pens are not\nallowed in archives,\nso if you want to take\nnotes, make sure you\ntake plenty of freshly\nsharpened pencils and a\nrubber with you!\npage 17",
            "What is the\nValue of the\nBernie Grant\nArchive?\nWhy Archives are Important Anyone interested in\n• Archives provide evidence of past actions, and can\nexplain why people or organizations acted in the\nway they did;\n• They can act as a cultural or community memory.\nThe existence of archives can reveal what a society\nchooses to remember and what it chooses to\nforget;\n• Archives are central to individuals seeking to\nestablish their identities. Records can help people\nto find their individual, family or community\nhistories, know who they are and where they come\nfrom;\n• Documents produced by organizations such\nas the United Nations (UN) can help people\nto understand their basic human rights. The\npublication of The Universal Declaration of Human\nRights (one of the first actions of the UN) is a\ngood example;\n•\nMaking archives accessible has played an important\nrole in assisting with claims for social justice,\nre-uniting families, and finding out more about\npersonal identities;\n• Archives can undermine myths & open up new\nways of thinking about a problem;\n•\n• Archives can help in finding new avenues of\nresearch;\nAllow voices to be heard that may not have access\nto mainstream institutions like the media or\nhistory books.\npage 18\nexploring the life and\ntimes of Bernie Grant\nwill find much that\nis of interest in this\nfascinating collection\nof papers, letters, and\naudio-visual material.\nBut the BGA does more\nthan give insights in to\nthe work of well-known\npolitician. It helps us\nto understand how\nperspectives on issues\nchange, and why policies\nand practices develop in\nthe way they do.\n\"Only if we\nunderstand\nour past\ncan we\nas...people\nmove\nforward in\nthe future.\"\nBernie Grant\nWhat politicians do\nor say is of great\nimportance to future\ngenerations. Private\npolitical papers such\nas Bernie Grant's are\nof considerable value\nbecause they:\n.\n• Document insights into\nthe actions of major\npolitical players and\ncampaigners of our\ntime;\n•\n•\nLook at letters written\nby Bernie Grant to\nfamous politicians and\nsee how they respond\nto his questions;\nOffer rich biographical\nmaterial, and\ninteresting detail not\nrevealed elsewhere,\non society's political\nleaders, unsung heroes\nand community leaders\nand activists;\nSearch through some\nof the early material,\nwhen Bernie Grant was\na Haringey Councillor\nand you will find some.\nnames that have since\nbecome familiar and\nsome that are not well\nknown at all. Why do\nyou think this is?\nHelp to give a voice\nto marginalized and\nneglected aspects\nof political and\ncommunity history,\nfrom the local to\nthe national and\ninternational;\nLook at all the different\ncountries Bernie Grant\nvisited, and think\nabout why this was an\nimportant aspect of his\nwork;\n• Reveal evidence of\ncultural change and\ntransformation;\nWhen Bernie Grant\npushed for equalities\npolicies, he was labeled\n'barmy' in the Press but\nmany of the changes\nhe argued for are now\ntaken as the norm.\nSee if you can trace\nthis change in attitude\nby examining press\ncuttings from the 1980s\nto 2000;\n• Provide the source\nmaterial through which\nnew perspectives\non history can be\nexplored or examined;\nBernie Grant was keen\nto promote knowledge\nof black history and\nculture. How do his\nstatements on the\nsubject relate to what\nyou see on display in\nmuseums, libraries and\narchives?\n.\nGive insight into how\nthe political processes\nwhich affect all our\nlives, work;\nHow did Bernie Grant\ndraw the public's\nattention to important\nissues? Look through\npapers that refer to\nHaringey Council\nand Parliamentary\nprocedures; what do\nthey tell us about how\nchanges happen (or\nnot)?\nRepresent a valuable\n'unofficial', often\ncontroversial version\nof events, frequently\nincluding details left\nout of formal, official\naccounts;\nLook through the\ncorrespondence\nbetween Bernie Grant\nand other MPs and\nbetween him and\nthe Press Complaints\nCouncil. What can\nyou find out from\nthis material that is\nnot discussed in the\nmedia a) about the\npeople involved in\nthese exchanges; and\nb) about how our ideas\nabout what is true are\nshaped?\npage 19",
            "How we set up the Bernie Grant Collection\nThank you\nThe Bernie Grant\nArchive has been\nestablished as a result\nof the determination\nand commitment of\nthe many people who\nadmired and supported\nhim. However to take\nthe project from an\nidea to a reality was not\nwithout difficulty - and\nthe process says much\nabout the real challenges\nstill associated with\npreserving the heritage\nof excluded groups in\nsociety.\nThe first step in\nestablishing the archive\nwas taken by Bernie's\nwidow, Sharon Grant,\nwho donated the\ncollection to the Bernie\nGrant Trust in 2001,\nand led the project as\nthe Secretary of the\nTrust. She persuaded\nthe National Archive to\nview the archive. They\nreadily agreed that the\ncollection was worthy of\npreservation, and their\nsupport and guidance\nproved invaluable.\nSuitable archival facilities\nare rare, and after a long\npage 20\nsearch, the agreement\nby Middlesex University\nto house the collection\nproved a major step\nforward.\nNext we approached\nnumerous organizations\nfor the funding we\nneeded to pay for the\nwork of sorting, listing\nand conserving the\ncollection. Eventually, a\ngrant was obtained from\nthe Heritage Lottery\nFund, and supplemented\nby donations given by\nBernie's family, many\nfriends, colleagues, and\norganizations. A shortage\nof professional archivists\nin the UK proved\nanother setback, but\nwhen Joanne Anthony,\nan Australian archivist,\nagreed to undertake the\nproject, the work began\nin earnest April 2003.\nThe past year has been\none of often hectic\nactivity and hard work,\nby the archivist and\nthe staff of the Bernie\nGrant Trust, and by\nmany others who have\ngiven their time, money\nand skills to ensure that\nthis ambitious project\nwas delivered on time.\nWe have succeeded in\nestablishing an accessible\ncollection, in a local\nlocation, to a high\nstandard, within a tight\nbudget, as well as an\naccompanying website\nwhich will ensure that\nthe life of a remarkable\nblack man is not lost to\nhistory. We believe that\nthe collection provides\na rich and unique\nresource for future\ngenerations who seek to\nunderstand a key period\nin the making of the\nmulti-racial Britain.\nThere is much more\nthat we wish do to\ndevelop the collection,\nand the Bernie Grant\nTrust will continue it\nefforts to resource\nfurther work. However,\nin the meantime, we\nlist below all of those\nwho have supported the\ncurrent project, and say\na big \"thank you\" to all\nof them.\nMs Y M Ababa\nMiss A Childs\nLeyland Grant\nWaveney Grant\nPeter Herbert QC\nHazel House\nDenise McGuire\nStuart McNamara\nRichard Charles Martin\nPeter Montoute\nA B Muhammad\nCaroline Newton\nSt Lucian Assoc. of\nLondon(1963)\nMs Jessie Stephens, MBE\nCecil Agard\nJBS Management Ltd\nNicky Gavron\nAndreas Michaelides\nDr D A Neil\nDr Edgar Neufeld\nM O'Connor\nSuzy Rigg\nGill Sargeant\nBen Summerskill\nHarry Barnes, MP\nMargaret Beckett, MP\nDavid Blunkett MP\nRichard Caborn, MP\nJean Corston, MP\nJohn Cryer, MP\nJim Cunningham, MP\nTerry Davis, MP\nBarry Field\nPaul Flynn, MP\nDavid Haslam\nPiarra Khabra, MP\nAshok Kumar, MP\nMike O'Brien, MP\nDennis Skinner, MP\nClive Soley, MP\nTeddy Taylor, MP\nJenny Tonge, MP\nYasmin Alibhai-Brown\nKeith Bennett\nSuzie Constantinides\nLiz Davies\nLouise Ellman, MP\nPaulette Fuller\nPauline Green\nHilary Moraes\nCrystal Rose\nSam Smethers\nAlbert Fortune\nS Gibson\nC Jeffries\nElsie Blair & Family\nJames Doolan\nM M Hamilton\nPat Tonge\nCarol Cheryl Joseph\nLord Victor Adebowale\nWayne Harber\nLord Desai\nMiss J Mitchell\nM Salmon\nBaroness Prashar\nMarsha Singh, MP\nPatricia Hewitt, MP\nLord Bhikhu Parekh\nBarbara Roche, MP\nLord King\nMr & Mrs Stephens\nKen Livingstone, Mayor\nof London\nTina & Rubuen Bilan\nCarroll\nJanice Panton\nAfrican Caribbean\nLeadership Council\nBrian Boylan\nChris Ofili-Afroco\nRumi Verjee\nDavid Adjaye\nCllr Herbie Brown\nStone Ashdown Trust\nC Jeffries\nP Younge\nLela Kogbara\nSharon Grant\nDarshna Soni\nJoanne Anthony, Project\nArchivist\nReading Room\nBruce Castle Museum\nMiddlesex University\nNational Archives\nHeritage Lottery Fund\nFocus International (UK)\nLtd\nCapital Accommodation\nInteract New Media\nKaren Wong\nJudy Richmond\nSteve King\nDr Norman James\nDr Lola Young\nSatellite Consortium Ltd\npage 21",

            "I 169\nChapter 1\nTHE INQUIRY PROCESS\nWHY HAVE AN INQUIRY?\n1.1 On 5th October 1985, four Tottenham police officers entered the\nhome of a Black woman, Mrs Cynthia Jarrett, and searched it. During\nthe course of the search Mrs Jarrett collapsed, and soon after she\ndied. On the following afternoon a demonstration outside Tottenham\npolice station passed off without any serious incident. But during the\nevening and night of 6th October, a violent disturbance took place at\nthe Broadwater Farm Estate, Tottenham. A police officer, PC Keith\nBlakelock, was killed. Several buildings were set on fire, as well as\nmany motor vehicles. Guns were alleged to have been fired at the\npolice. Officers armed with plastic bullets and CS gas were deployed\nbut not used. In a television interview, the senior officer for the North\nLondon area, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Richards, claimed that\nthe disturbances were \"the most ferocious, the most vicious riots ever\nseen on the mainland\". In the weeks and months following 6th\nOctober, police officers remained on the estate in considerable\nnumbers, and raids were carried out by large squads of police upon\ndozens of homes.\n1.2 The disturbances were the third to have happened in the space\nof a month. On the nights of 9th and 10th of September 1985 two men\nhad died in a Post Office which had been burned in the course of\ndisturbances which stretched over two days in the Handsworth and\nLozells districts of Birmingham. The local authorities for that area\nacted swiftly to investigate the causes of the disturbances. Following\nthe refusal of the Home Secretary to set up a public inquiry, the\nBirmingham City Council set up an independent public inquiry under\nthe chairmanship of a barrister. The West Midlands police force\nparticipated in that inquiry. The Race Relations and Equal\nOpportunities Committee of the West Midlands County Council\nsponsored a review panel to establish the nature and extent of\n3",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHE INQUIRY PROCESS\nlegitimate grievances of the Black community, and to make\nrecommendations for urgent action. Both of these inquiries published\ntheir reports in the early months of 1986.\n1.3 On 28th September 1985, Mrs Cherry Groce, another Black\nwoman, had been shot and paralysed inside her home in Brixton by a\npolice officer carrying out a raid. Disturbances broke out on the\nstreets of Brixton over the following day. A police officer was\nsuspended and later charged, and awaits trial on a charge of causing\ngrievous bodily harm to Mrs Groce with intent.\n1.4 On 14th October 1985 the council of the London Borough of\nHaringey called for \"a thoroughly independent public inquiry into the\ndeath of Mrs Jarrett and subsequent events and into the break down\nin police/community relations in Tottenham\". The council resolved\nthat if there was not an adequate Government response, it would set\nup its own independent public inquiry. The Home Secretary again\ndecided not to exercise his powers under the Police Act 1964 to set up\na public inquiry. In a letter to Haringey's chief executive, the Home\nOffice referred to Lord Scarman's inquiry, and said: -\n\"The Home Secretary does not believe that a rerun of such an\ninquiry would be likely to cast a new perspective on the situation:\nThe broader issues raised by the disorders continue to be the\nsubject of widespread public debate and in the Home Secretary's\nview there are no grounds for believing that there are radical new\nsolutions waiting for an inquiry to uncover.\"\nThe Home Office claimed also that a public inquiry would cut across\nthe investigation of the Police Complaints Authority into the death of\nMrs Jarrett.\n1.5 There then followed a delay of several months while the council\ntried to find a person who would be willing to be chair of the\nindependent inquiry which they wished to set up. Mr Mark\nBonham-Carter said publicly that he would not serve as chair\nbecause the Commissioner had indicated that the police would not\nparticipate. In our view this was not a good reason; the issues raised\nby the disturbances and the grievances which were being voiced\ndemanded urgent investigation. But the delay was unfortunate - by\nthe time we began our work, memories had faded and some of the\nimpact which the Inquiry could have had was lost.\n4\n1.6 In early February 1986, Lord Gifford QC was asked to take on\nthe chairmanship of the Inquiry and accepted. Some of the other\nmembers of the panel had already been approached; others were\ninvited by the chair himself. The aim was to bring together a broad\nbased panel of people who had personal and professional experience\nof the issues which the Inquiry would have to confront. From the\noutset the Inquiry Panel asserted its independence; we did not, for\ninstance, accept the terms of reference drafted by the council, but\ndrew up our own terms of reference to enable us to conduct a\nwide-ranging inquiry into the underlying causes of the disturbances.\nThe qualifications of the members of the panel, and the terms of\nreference of the Inquiry are given in the preface to this report. The\ncouncil approved the appointment of the chair and four members of\nthe Inquiry Panel, and its terms of reference, on 18th February\n1986. The membership of the Inquiry Panel was finally completed\nwith the appointment of Mr Randolph Prime at the end of February.\n1.7 At a well-attended opening meeting on 21st February 1986, the\nchair explained why the members of the panel had agreed to take\npart:-\n\"Why have we taken on this task? Because we believe that an\ninquiry is needed. We believe that you in this community want an\nindependent and fair inquiry. Your presence here indicates that this\nis so.\n\"People do not attack the forces of the law out of mere wickedness\nor a sense of fun. As Lord Scarman said only last week in a\ntelevised broadcast, 'Public disorder usually arises out of a sense of\ninjustice.' There are causes to these events going back over many\nyears. They must be recorded and made known.\n\"When there is conflict in society it is always the powerful\ninstitutions which find it easy to put out a version of the events\nwhich even if it is only based on hearsay - is reported by the\nmass media as if there were no other truth.\n\"Those without power have no such voice. Our task is to listen to\nthe powerless as well as the powerful. To listen to the ordinary\npeople of this community and the organisations which represent\nthem. And having listened to everyone, to produce\nrecommendations which can be used to bring about change.\"\n1.8 In the particular context of the Broadwater Farm, there was a\nneed to provide a channel for the grievances and complaints of the\n5",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHE INQUIRY PROCESS\nlocal community, and to investigate a number of disputed issues.\nThere was bitter dispute about the circumstances of the death of Mrs\nJarrett, and a widespread distrust of the Police Complaints Authority,\nwhich was then investigating the conduct of the officers who entered\nher house. There was bitter dispute about the way in which the\ndisturbances broke out, with accusations of deliberate planning and\nprovocation on both sides. And beyond all that, there was bitter\ndispute about the record and the reputation of a whole community.\nAs we shall show, a large section of the police and mass media saw\nthe Broadwater Farm as a centre of well organised criminality. To\nmany others in authority, both in central and local government,\nBroadwater Farm was a showpiece, a model of what a responsible and\nhard working community could do to better the conditions of all its\nmembers.\n1.9 The Inquiry set itself four objectives:―\n(1) To seek out evidence in the most thorough way possible and\nfrom the widest possible range of opinions;\n(2) To reflect that evidence objectively and impartially in our report;\n(3) To make an independent and logical analysis of that evidence;\n(4) To make sensible proposals for the future which can be studied\nby those who have responsibilities to bear for the welfare of the\ncommunity.\nTHE WORK OF THE INQUIRY\n1.10 At the outset of the Inquiry, during the opening session on 21st\nFebruary, we became vividly aware of a cloud of fear which hung over\nBroadwater Farm. Some who attended sat far away at the back of a\ngallery. Others shielded their heads when a television crew tried to\nfilm the audience. Many more, we were told, would stay away and not\ncome forward. During our first full hearing we asked Floyd Jarrett\nhow we could approach such people. He replied:-\n\"I can't really see a solution because you see they have become so\nfrightened that they don't know who to trust in the system.\"\nJoanne George, social service community worker at Broadwater Farm\nsaid:-\n\"I think people are still afraid to talk to anybody, because they fear\nbeing arrested. Even though the Inquiry has explained about\nconfidentiality, they just feel that they can't risk doing that. And\nunfortunately it is probably those people who know more about\n6\nwhat happened on 6th October than any of us who are free to come\nand talk here.\"\nTo us, this climate of fear was itself a matter of intense concern. It is\ndeeply disturbing if people not only have strong grievances, but dare\nnot speak out about them.\n1.11. To secure our first objective, we went far beyond the normal\ninquiry process whereby any interested person or organisation was\ninvited to put in written submissions and give evidence at public\nhearings. We turned the Inquiry into an active process. Members of\nthe Inquiry Panel themselves, as well as the Inquiry staff, knocked on\ndoors, held interviews, and attended meetings in the community. We\npublished two newsletters, which were distributed throughout the\nBroadwater Farm Estate and neighbouring streets. At the public\nhearings, we encouraged participation by members of the public. In\nall these ways, we reached out into the community. We could not\nremove the cloud of fear, but by treating people's fears as being\nserious and reasonable, we believe we obtained far more information\nthan a formal \"judicial\" inquiry would have done.\n1.12 The statistics of our work show that we invited evidence from\n116 organisations, and from all members of the Haringey Council. We\nheld 22 public hearings, at which we heard a total of 77 witnesses. We\nheld recorded interviews with 80 people. At meetings and visits to the\nestate, we listened to many more who wished to speak without fear of\nbeing identified. We were also aware of the danger of relying solely\non the views of those who chose to come forward. Since it was\napparent that people living in a number of the Broadwater Farm\nblocks would have had a clear view of the disturbances, we called on\n178 homes and received a number of accounts of what people had\nseen. We believe we were able in this way to build up an objective\npicture of what took place.\n1.13 We were aware also that there were disputed views about who\nrepresented the \"community\" of Broadwater Farm. While there were\norganisations which the council accepted as being representative,\nothers, including the police, appeared to dispute that they were.\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Richards in his report on the\ndisturbances (the Richards report) spoke of normal policing methods\nbeing resised by \"a vociferous minority\".\n7",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHE INQUIRY PROCESS\n1.14 We wanted as far as possible to ascertain objectively who were\n\"the community\" on Broadwater Farm and what they thought about\nthe key issues before the Inquiry - the police, crime, the estate, the\nYouth Association. We therefore commissioned a survey to be carried\nout by a team from Middlesex Polytechnic, headed by Dr. Jock\nYoung. The survey drew a large sample of 700 adults out of a total of\nabout 1800 adults on the estate. We asked for people's co-operation in\nresponding to the survey, and got it - the response rate was 75.2%,\nwhich is far higher than other surveys in similar areas. The results are\nanalysed in Chapter 7 of the report.\n1.15 The Inquiry also undertook or commissioned three further\npieces of research:-\n(1) Members of the Inquiry and staff carried out a study of the\ntreatment by the local media of the Broadwater Farm Estate and of\n\"riots\" in general.\n(2) The Inquiry employed its own research worker to make a\nindependent evaluation of Haringey's economic and social\nconditions, and the policies of the council in relevant areas.\n(3) The Inquiry commissioned the consultancy firm, Equinox, to\nconsider initiatives aimed at assisting in the economic development\nof the Broadwater Farm area in the field of small businesses and\nco-operatives.\nThis research provided material which we use in making our proposals\nin Chapter 9 of the report.\n1.16 By gathering evidence in these forms, we believe that we have\nobtained as full a picture as was possible in the time available. We\nhave only been able to achieve this through the strenuous and devoted\nwork of the staff of the Inquiry, the interviewers, transcribers and\nresearchers, and more important still, through the co-operation of the\nhundreds of people who gave time to speak to us.\nTHE SUB JUDICE QUESTION\n1.17 The days from 6th to 7th of October saw two tragic deaths,\nthose of Cynthia Jarrett and Keith Blakelock. Both had been greatly\nloved and admired. Their deaths, and the need to prevent such\ntragedies from recurring, were in our minds continually and\nunderlined the seriousness of the Inquiry. In the case of Mrs Cynthia\nJarrett, the inquest into her death has been concluded, and we have\nbeen free to comment on the evidence given and the verdict recorded.\n8\nRegrettably, we cannot deal with the circumstances surrounding the\ndeath of PC Keith Blakelock. A number of people are awaiting trial\nfor his murder. It would be unlawful to discuss, even in general terms,\nhow he was killed and who was to blame.\n1.18 However, PC Blakelock had died in a place removed from the\nmain areas of action, following a particular incident of which most\npeople involved in the disturbances would have been unaware. The\npending proceedings do not preclude a discussion of all the other\nissues relating to the outbreak of the disturbances and the course they\ntook.\n1.19 By the end of May 1986, 162 people had been charged with\noffences alleged to have been committed on 6th October. 13 people\nhave now been charged with riotous assembly, of whom six are also\ncharged with murder. 62 are charged with affray, some of whom face\nother counts of burglary, throwing petrol bombs, and of manu-\nfacturing petrol bombs.\nMost of the others were charged with lesser offences such as threat-\nening behaviour and burglary. Only three of the riot or affray cases\nhave been dealt with by the court. We mention in Chapters 5 and 6\nthat these trials also prevent us from expressing a conclusive view on\nthe legality of certain actions and on certain aspects of the police\ninvestigation after the 6th October.\nTHE INQUIRY AND THE POLICE\n1.20 From the outset we made it clear that we wanted to have the\nfull participation of the Metropolitan Police in the Inquiry. Even\nbefore his appointment became public, Lord Gifford asked for an\ninformal meeting with D.A.C. Richards, in order to assure him of the\nindependence and serious purpose of the Inquiry. This request was\nnot accepted. On 20th February 1986, Lord Gifford wrote to the\nCommissioner, Sir Kenneth Newman:-\n\"I am most anxious that the police view should be fully put to the\nInquiry, particularly on the general questions which are certain to\narise about police/community relations. I would wish to be entirely\nflexible in the way in which that view should be made known. I\nunderstand that it may not be appropriate for the police to be\nofficially represented in the public sessions of the Inquiry - though\nwe would welcome such representation if it were desired. I hope,\nhowever, that you and Mr Richards will leave the door open for\n9",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nother forms of communication with us, whether written or oral,\npublic or private.\"\n1.21 On 26th February, the Commissioner wrote giving three\nreasons for declining to give evidence to the Inquiry:-\n(1) He referred to the inquiries which were already taking place,\nnamely the inquest into Mrs Jarrett's death; the report of D.A.C.\nRichards; the investigation of the Police Complaints Authority; and\nthe internal review undertaken by the Metropolitan Police. He said\nthat \"a further inquiry would be likely to add little to those already\nundertaken\".\n(2) \"The statutory procedures for accountability laid down for the\nMetropolitan Police are to the Home Secretary and the borough\nconsultative groups. Your inquiry cuts across those lines of\naccountability.'\n(3) He referred to the pending criminal proceedings which he claimed\nwould be \"an effective barrier to investigations under some of your\nterms of reference.\"\nThe Commissioner ended that \"in all the circumstances, I am not\npersuaded that any useful purpose would be served by our meeting.\"\n1.22 On 4th March, Lord Gifford replied to these three points:-\n(1) \"The inquiries which you mention are all limited in scope. Those\nwhich are independent of the police, are limited to the circum-\nstances of Mrs Jarrett's death. The report to the Consultative\nGroup (The Richards report) has aroused considerable controversy\nand cannot be regarded as presenting the full account of the causes\nof the disturbances. The internal review concerns policing\nprocedures rather than the underlying causes of disorder. I am\nconvinced that it is right to probe further.\n(2) We do not set ourselves up as a body to which the police should\nbe accountable. Rather we are a group of concerned citizens,\nseeking to discover the truth as best we can, and to make\nrecommendations which might prevent a recurrence of the tragic\nevents of last October.\n(3) We accept that there are limitations imposed by the sub judice\nrules. But there are considerable and important areas of the Inquiry\nwhich do not require findings to be made about specific sub judice\nincidents.\"\nLord Gifford concluded by asking the Commissioner not to close his\nmind to the possibility of an exchange of views at some stage, if there\n10\nTH\nTHE INQUIRY PROCESS\nwere developments in the Inquiry which made it reasonable to\napproach him again.\nDET\n1.23 On 6th May, after we had heard ten days of evidence, Lord\nGifford wrote again asking for the view of the Metropolitan Police on\nkey questions which had by then emerged. The questions were put\nunder ten headings:-\n(1) Police co-operation with the Broadwater Farm Estate.\n(2) Police intelligence about Broadwater Farm.\n(3) Drug trafficking in September, 1985.\n(4) Police deployment around 7.00 p.m. on 6th October 1985.\n(5) Police tactics during the disturbances.\n(6) Methods of making arrests.\n(7) Levels of policing.\n(8) Racist behaviour by police officers.\n(9) Police training.\n(10) The future.\nLord Gifford concluded:-\n\"I urge you to respond as fully as possible to these questions. It\nwould seem to me that your reasons for not wishing the police to\nparticipate in our Inquiry would not preclude you from commenting\non these important issues over which my colleagues and I both as\nan Inquiry Panel and as London residents are deeply\nconcerned.\"\n1.24 Sir Kenneth Newman's reply on 28th May was brief:-\n\"Thank you for your letter of 6th May 1986, the contents of which\nhave been noted.\n\"My letter of 26th February set out the reasons in declining to give\nevidence to your Inquiry into the Broadwater Farm disorders.\nNothing has occurred since which leads me to alter that reasoning,\nand your letter contains nothing which causes me to reconsider that\ndecision.\"\n1.25 We deeply regret the decision of the Commissioner and find his\nreasons to be unconvincing. Because of the position which he took, it\nwas difficult for a number of police officers whom we knew to be\nanxious to talk to us, to do so openly. However we have not been\nshort of material from which we can discover the views of police\nofficers about issues relevant to our Inquiry.

            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHE\nTHE ESTATE AND ITS PEOPLE\nthe press) cloaked the ugly reality of criminal gangs ruling the\nestate, robbing and terrorising the inhabitants, and making daily\nwar on any police officers who dared to venture near.\"\nD.A.C. Richards, the officer in charge of Number 1 area, which\nincludes Haringey, shared the view of the rank and file:-\n2.3\n\"The estate has earned an unenviable reputation over recent years.\nas one where normal policing methods are resisted by a vociferous\nminority and where unprovoked attacks on police are all too\ncommon.\"\nWe have no doubt that these conflicting perceptions of the estate\nwere of central importance in the build up to the disturbances, and\nthat they continue to have a divisive and dangerous effect on police/\ncommunity relations. It has therefore become central to our Inquiry\nto trace the history of the Broadwater Farm Estate and its\ncommunity, to assess how such extreme and opposite views have\ncome to be formed.\nTHE BUILDING OF THE ESTATE\n-\n2.4 Broadwater Farm was built on open land which had been used\nfor allotments. Local residents were angry at the plan, and hired a\nlawyer to fight against it. Running through the site was the Moselle\nriver, which flooded at times of heavy rainfall one of the reasons\nfor building the blocks on stilts above ground level. Another reason\nwas the stipulation by the council that there should be car parking for\none car for every flat, plus a further 10% for visitors. Since the\ncouncil also required a high density development, car parking could\nbe provided at ground level with the blocks interconnected with\nwalkways.\n2.5 In 1965, when the brief was given to the Borough Architect, the\nnew Labour Government was encouraging local authorities to achieve\na target of one thousand new units a year. Scandinavian industrialised\nbuilding schemes were in fashion. The contract for Broadwater Farm\nwas won by Taylor Woodrow using the Larsen-Neilson method of\nsystem building. One consequence of using such systems is that the\ndesign of the estate is largely taken out of the hands of the council's\narchitects. The head of the team of architects at the time was Salem\nEl-Doori, who said:-\n\"Once the contractor is nominated and selected they have the\nultimate say, because they are guaranteeing the constuction, it is\n14\ntheir system, it is their patent. You are aware that a great deal of\nthe control is being taken out of your hands. But for local\nauthorities such systems were very attractive because of the speed\nof building, economy of resources, and the difficulty of finding\nskilled building labour.\"\n2.6 Contrary to widespread belief, the estate did not receive any\narchitectural award. But it was built with the highest hopes. In the\nwords of Roy Limb, Haringey's Chief Executive:-\n\"The chair of Planning in those days thought Broadwater Farm\nwould be an everlasting memorial to him and his committee - that\nwas a genuine belief. I have talked to him about it since then. What\nthey were trying to do seemed the right thing at the time.\"\nMost of the new residents were rehoused from slum clearance\nschemes. But 34 flats were made available to the ordinary waiting list,\nand lots were drawn to choose the people whom the local press\ndescribed as \"the lucky 34 who will be given tenancy of brand new\nflats in the Broadwater Farm Estate.\"\n2.7 Construction started in the middle of 1967 but was held up for a\ntime in 1968 after the Ronan Point disaster. Flats became available in\nsuccessive blocks as they were completed, with the last block finished\nin February 1973.\nThe reactions of the early inhabitants were enthusiastic. As Ernie\nLarge, chair of Housing until 1968, explained:-\n\"What we were doing was clearing slums in South Tottenham and\nother parts of the borough, so that people who actually went into\nthe Broadwater flats originally found them palaces compared with\nwhat they were living in previously i.e. back to back slums.\"\n2.8 The quality of the flats themselves has been stressed by many\nwitnesses. They were spacious, peaceful, and above all warm. Sheila\nRamdin, now chair of the Residents' Association, said:-\n\"I love this flat. There is no way I would go when this flat is so hot.\nYou don't have to wear no jumper or no socks or anything in\ndoors. You can just go about in your T-shirt. That's how warm\nthese flats are.\"\nDolly Kiffin, founder of the Youth Association, described her feelings\nwhen she moved in:-\n\"There was a lot of peace there. The front room was quite big, and\nit was so warm for the kids. You did not have to bother with\n15",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHE ESTATE AND ITS PEOPLE\nheaters like paraffin heaters. It was all nice and clean. And\nespecially at night when you sit on the patio and look all over, it's a\nbeautiful sight.\"\n2.9 When finally completed in February 1973, the Broadwater Farm\nEstate contained 1063 properties in 12 blocks, each of them built off\nthe ground and connected by raised walkways. Ten of the blocks are\nlow rise, having four or six storeys. Two (Northolt and Kenley) are\nhigh rise blocks of 18 storeys. The central block, Tangmere, was built\nin the form of a ziggurat, consisting of flats with balconies surrounding\na shopping precinct. The estate also includes a small group of two\nstorey houses on the higher ground close to The Avenue; otherwise\nthe accommodation was in flats and maisonettes of one, two, and\nthree bedrooms. The housing was built over 21 acres of land at a\ndensity of approximately 140 persons per acre.\n2.10 What was lacking were the essentials for making the estate into\na living community for over 3000 people. The original design provided\nfor shops, pub, a launderette, and a doctor's and dentist's surgery.\nOnly the shops survived. As Mr Murray of the council's Building\nDesign Services explained:-\n\"What happens when tenders come in, is that the tenders are\nalways high, things are cut out, and what is cut out is thought to be\nthe froth or the icing on the cake. And these will always be things\nlike pubs and community centres.\nAs a member of the panel observed, and Mr Murray agreed: \"What\nwe know now is that they are not the icing on the cake. They are the\nfruit itself.\"\n2.11 In an unattractive location under one of the walkways on\nWillan Road, a small clubroom was built for the Tenants' Association.\nIt was not part of the original design. The club cost £16,000 to build,\nand the council's decision in December 1972 to spend £8,000 in a\ngrant to the Tenants' Association to fit it out as a bar was strongly\nopposed by the opposition party. \"DOWN THE HATCH - IT'S ON\nTHE RATES\" was the headline in the local paper. For years the club\nwas the only facility on the estate. It was used as a lunch club for\npensioners and in the evening as a bar. We will return to consider the\nrole which it played in the community.\n2.12 The estate not only lacked amenities but was cut off from the\n16\nsurrounding areas. Transport facilities were poor; the walk to the\nbuses in Lordship Lane was inconvenient, particularly for older\npeople. Attempts were made by the council as early as 1972 to\npersuade London Transport to run a bus service through the estate.\nBut to this day no such service exists.\n2.13 On the edge of the estate were built the Broadwater Farm\nInfants and Junior Schools, which conveniently served the families on\nthe estate. (For secondary schooling, children go to almost all of the\nten schools in Haringey). But in addition there were three buildings,\nconstructed close to the estate which had no relationship to it; the\nWilliam C. Harvey School for children with special educational needs\narising from severe learning difficulties, and the Moselle School for\nchildren with moderate learning difficulties, both situated to the north\nof the estate; and a hostel for older children in care, situated on\nWillan Road near the entrance to the estate. Witnesses from the\nEducation Department told us that the siting of these schools \"doesn't\nmake sense\"; Roy Limb explained that these institutions had been put\nwhere they were in order to be \"part of the community\", but\nrecognised that on Broadwater Farm \"things got out of balance\". No\nthought appears to have been given to the design of any of the schools\nto enable them to be available for general community use.\n2.14 The estate does have access to the open space of the Lordship\nRecreation Ground - a facility which could have been put to far\ngreater use than it has. The Haringey Sports Council, in a strong\nsubmission to us have pointed out that over the last few years the\nopen air theatre on the recreation ground has been little used; the\ncricket pitches have become unusable; the boating lake and children's\nwaterfall have disappeared; and the changing facilities and toilets have\nfallen into a disgusting condition. There was also the Lido swimming\npool to the north of the estate, which was closed in 1983. turiz\n2.15 The residents in the nearby terraced streets had opposed the\nplans and disliked the reality. A nearby resident of 20 years standing\ndescribed to us his view of the estate as \"like a wart on one's hand, a\nmonstrosity, out of character for the area\". From the beginning, there\nbegan to emerge a dangerous polarisation between the estate and its\nneighbours.hal\nTHE PROBLEMS OF THE 1970S\n2.16 The high hopes of the planners were confounded almost from\n17",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nточ\nESTATE AND ITS PEOPLE\nthe start. The history of Broadwater Farm through the 1970s is a\nspiral of deterioration. Its reputation became so bad that virtually\nnobody accepted a offer of housing on the estate unless they were\nhomeless and had no choice. In 1980, less than ten years after it had\nbeen built, the estate featured in a Department of the Environment\nreport of an investigation into difficult to let housing. It described how\n\"Lakeside Estate\", a pseudonym for Broadwater Farm, had gone into\na \"catastrophic slide\" in popularity. Its conclusions were pessimistic:-\n\"At best the local authority can hope to make it tolerable for the\nnext decade or so, but eventually, because the estate is so\nmonolithic and comprises such a large portion of their total\nhousing, the possibility of demolition is one that will have to be\nconsidered.\"\nIt is one of the features of our Inquiry that this forecast has been\nconfounded, and that the bleak picture has radically changed. Before\ndescribing the change, we must assess the reasons for such a rapid\ndecline.\n2.17 In the first place, there were severe problems arising from\nstructural defects and disrepair. Water penetration had affected some\nflats from the early 1970s. Cockroaches were found to take advantage\nof easy passages through the gaps between the industrialised building\nslabs. Above all the council's response to complaints about\nmaintenance and disrepair was shoddy. The council's evidence to us\ndescribes a petition presented by tenants in 1981:-\n\"(The Petition) complained of poor security and a major burglary\nproblem, frequent lift breakdowns, graffiti, poor repairs service, a\npoor cleansing service, unfair allocation policies, water penetration\nand inadequate spending on estate improvements. Most of these\ncomplaints speak for themselves and were certainly justified by the\nsituation existing on the estate at that time.\"\n2.18. Many of those who have been closely involved with the estate\nrecalled the situation which had developed by 1981.\nRussell Simper, now the estate supervisor, was then a caretaker:-\n\"The youths used to hang about, people used to break the\nwindows, doors were hanging off, the wood frames were rotten and\nit generally started to become a run down place. In the end, tenants\njust get disheartened and they just want to move.\"\nHe said that there was a meeting in the late 1970s when tenants\n\"threatened to lynch the council if the council didn't come down and\n18\nstart doing some repairs on the estate and making people have\nsomewhere decent to live in\".\n2.19 Joanne George, who has played an important role as chair of\nthe Tenants' Association and is now a social services community\nworker on the estate, arrived in 1980 as a homeless parent:-\n\"The first thing that actually hit me was the condition of the estate\nand the flat that I was first offered itself. The estate was dirty, there\nwas lots of vandalism, lots of grass, the flat I was allocated was in a\nreally bad state of repair. There was no kitchen sink, there was no\nkitchen cupboard, there was a hole in the floor. It was just\nhorrendous. It looked to me like squatters had lived there. All the\npassages had graffiti and stains all over it. It was absolutely\ndisgusting and I was told, 'sorry, no money for decorations'.\"\n2.20 The problems became exacerbated in the mind of the public by\nsensational reporting in the local press. The tenants, who might have\nwelcomed a serious inquiry into the real problems which existed, hit\nback against what they felt to be a smearing of the estate and its\ninhabitants. The first of a number of \"shock reports\" was published by\nthe Hornsey Journal on 11th May 1973, under the headline:-\n\"MARRIAGES ON ROCKS AMONG THE CONCRETE SAYS\nREPORT ON HIGH RISE LIVING.\"\nThe \"report\" had been written by a junior school teacher and leaked\nto the newspaper, which published it with many photographs and\ndescribed it as painting a \"scarifying picture\". One quotation reads as\na first example of the racist labelling which was to become more\nfrequent:-\n-\n\"Problem' families many of them single parent families were\nseen to be placed together,\" claimed the author. \"The sight of\nunmarried West Indian mothers walking about the\naggravated racial tension.\"\nHowever tenants on the estate were reported by the newspaper as\ndisagreeing vehemently with such a view of the estate.\n2.21 On 30th April 1976 the Tottenham Weekly Herald published a\n\"survey\" carried out by two of its reporters under the headline:-\n\"FAMILIES WHO LIVE IN THE SHADOW OF VIOLENCE'.\nFear haunts the gloomy passages, lifts and entrances of Broadwater\nFarm Estate.\"\nAgain the residents, led by the president of the Tenants' Association,\nprotested at \"total mis-representation of the facts\".\n19",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHE ESTATE AND ITS PEOPLE\n2.22 On 6th October 1978 under the headline \"EXPERT RAPS\nTERROR FLATS\" the Weekly Herald reported:-\n\"An explosive survey carried out by a sociologist appointed by\nTottenham Liberals claims that the 1,063 tenants on Broadwater\nFarm Estate are living in a 'sub-culture of violence'. The sociologist\nsays there is complete social disorganisation.\"\nThere was a strong reaction from residents who wrote to the paper,\nsuch as one who stated:-\n\"I can speak from personal experience. I am a woman. I do not\nsuffer from tension or depression and have many friends like myself\nand am extremely lucky to live on Broadwater Farm.\"\nOthers set up a \"Broadwater Farm Council Tenants' Protection\nAction Group\" in opposition to the Tenants' Association, but it was\nshort-lived and seems to have attracted little support. The local home\nbeat officer was reported in the press as expressing little anxiety about\nthe situation:-\n\"PC Stratton said that crime was no worse on the estate than\nanywhere else. 'And you are more likely to get mugged at Bruce\nGrove than here.' He added that Broadwater Farm is being\nadequately policed and most relations with the Tenants'\nAssociation are very good.\"\n2.23 Thus we see as the contributory factors to the terrible image to\nthe estate, a combination of on the one hand real grievances, such as\nthe poor maintenance, unrectified structural defects and the\ninadequate facilities, and on the other hand an unjust labelling from\noutside, from the press and from neighbouring residents. The\nlabelling became attached not just to the buildings but also to the\npeople, as if they too were undesirable. Residents on the estate had\nsevere problems with hire purchase or T.V. hire facilities, or\nobtaining goods from catalogues. Deposits were required for the\ninstallation of gas and electricity. There was even a kind of social\nostracism, as illustrated by evidence from on the one hand Russell\nSimper:-\n\"It gets blown out of proportion. People from outside read the\npaper, they say: 'Cor, what a flipping place, Broadwater Farm.\"\nThey've never been on Broadwater Farm, they've never lived on\nBroadwater Farm, but they get the wrong impression of\nBroadwater Farm. Then when people who live on Broadwater\nFarm go on a bus and someone says: 'Oh, hello,' and they start\ntalking they say: 'Where do you live?' 'I live on Broadwater Farm'\n20\n'Oh, I wouldn't live over there for a pension'. This makes people\ndisheartened. It's making out that I'm no good because I live on\nBroadwater Farm.\"\nThen on the other hand we had the view of a nearby resident:-\n\"I don't want to have friends on that estate. I wouldn't go there to\nmake friends. I would like to see you go round the houses and say:\n'What do you reckon should be done?' They would all say: 'Raze it\nto the ground'. That would be the answer.\"\n2.24 The image of the estate inevitably affected the pattern of\nlettings. The numbers of those who wanted to transfer were double\nthe borough average - 20% of all tenants by 1976. The numbers\nrefusing an offer of a place on the estate was also far higher than the\naverage. Borough Housing Officer Barry Simons made a\ncomprehensive report on the situation in October 1976, which said:-\n\"Since very few tenants wished to transfer to Broadwater, and\nmany housing applicants refused accommodation there, dwellings\ntended to be left to those whose need was most urgent, and the\nestate has received up to now an unusually large share of homeless\nand single parent families. In all, 75% of acceptances on voids on\nBroadwater in 1975 were by homeless families, compared to 24%\nof voids elsewhere in Haringey.\"\nIn a thoughtful section on race relations the report discussed the\ndangers of such a trend, and the need for consultation about\nallocation policies:-\n\"A policy which has the effect of dispersing an ethnic minority\naway from unpopular estates can be justified if it accords with that\nminority's issues and takes account of individual preferences.\"\n2.25 The council adopted recommendations in the report designed\nto broaden the social mix on the estate. They resolved that no more\nhomeless people or one parent families should be allocated to\nBroadwater for two years; only one void in three should be offered to\nfurnished tenants (who were predominantly Black); and one void in\nseven would be offered to households outside the waiting list, such as\nkey workers. But these policies did not last. In September 1979 the\ncouncil reverted to a policy of allocating vacancies on Broadwater\nFarm in accordance with boroughwide housing policy. It was\nconsidered that it was not possible to alter the composition of an\nestate through allocation policies, and that the image of an estate\n21",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHE ESTATE AND ITS PEOPLE\ncreated by press publicity had more impact on the choices which\npeople made.\n2.26 Throughout these changes in policy a large proportion of new\nlettings were made to homeless families: 70% in 1980, decreasing to\n48% in 1982. They went to Broadwater Farm because they had no\nchoice; before November 1981, a homeless family was only given one\noffer. They had needs for themselves and their children for which the\ncouncil failed to make provision. Dolly Kiffin described their\nsituation:-\n\"It was just young people with children, unemployed, that was\ncoming onto the Broadwater Farm to live. They hadn't got any\ncarpet, furniture, anything, and there is problems for social security\nto give them these things. So they struggle, and the struggle get\nharder and harder. You could see the frustration in the young\npeople there.\"\n2.27 We have tried to discover to what extent the lettings on the\nestate were being made to Black people. One Black resident from\n1973 described the trend to us in direct terms:-\n\"As the Black people came in, the Whites went out.\"\nThe difficulty is that the council's Housing Department has not\ncarried out any ethnic monitoring of lettings to their housing stock. So\nthey have deprived themselves of the information which would be\nessential to consider whether there were discriminatory practices in\ndecisions being made by council officers about the estate. For as\nWilliam Trant, speaking on behalf of the West Indian Standing\nConference, said to us:-\n\"I do not feel that there is anything that is horribly bad about\nhaving large concentrations of Black people in a particular area,\nbecause I believe that it provides the strength and support that we\nneed. But at the same time what I am saying is that it ought not to\nbe the case where the less desirable estates are allocated to Black\npeople\"\nWe agree. As we shall see, it was Black people on the estate who led\nthe fight against the estate's decline.\n2.28 The best information which we have about the numbers of\nBlack and White people on the estate is that in the 1981 census, 42%\nof the residents of Broadwater Farm had heads of households who\n22\nwere born in the new Commonwealth. Our own survey shows that the\nethnic breakdown of adults is now as follows:- mod\nWhite\nAfro-Caribbean\nIndian subcontinent\nOther\ndoidw\n49%\n42%\n3%\n6%\n2.29 The only community facility on the estate, the social club under\nthe walkway, offered little welcome to Black people. It did provide a\nfriendly environment for some residents of the estate, and we have\nheard from older people who enjoyed coming down for a regular\nevening drink. But it was dominated by a few individuals who did not\noperate it for the whole estate. As Malcolm Sargison, community\nworker on the estate from 1978 to 1981, said: \"They saw themselves\nas a social club and not a community centre.\" Around 1981, serious\nfinancial irregularities had emerged. These were investigated by the\nCommunity Development Department and led to the sacking of staff.\nWhile some have claimed that there was no discrimination against\nBlack people in the club, there was too much evidence to the contrary\nfor us to accept that claim. The following quotations describe the real\nposition:-\n\"There were requests from within the Black community that for\nonly one night a week they could have some kind of chance to do\nsomething pertaining to different cultures, and this request was\nalways turned down. The social club actually became a pub. There\nwere several occasions where Black people were assaulted and\nbodily beaten in there, badly beaten.\" (Stafford Scott).\n\"I went for membership and I was turned away I did not know\nwhy.\" (Clasford Sterling).\n\"It's fair to say that in 1976-80 before the emergence of the Youth\nAssociation, the social club appeared to be predominantly White.\"\n(Ernie Large).\n\"There was a social club downstairs - White people and the token\nBlack. If you wasn't part of that token, you go in there, you soon\nget out of it. There were a couple of times you would get kicked\nout of there as well.\" (Black resident since 1973).\n\"There were only a few Black people on the estate that used to go\ndown there regularly and there were quite a few who lived off the\nestate. The main thing there was playing dominoes. I used to hear\nracist remarks about them slamming down their dominoes.\" (White\nwoman resident).\n23",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHE ESTATE AND ITS PEOPLE\n2.30 So the estate before 1981 offered nothing to young Black\npeople except a home. They were effectively excluded from the social\nclub. They had no other facilities on the estate. The young men, many\nof them unemployed, had nothing to do. The old people were afraid\nof them, the police suspected them. The young women with children\nwere isolated and lonely. The teenagers had the use of a flat in\nHawkinge block which operated on three evenings a week, but\nnothing more. The physical appearance of the estate was run down\nand ill maintained. In 1981 a new organisation - the Broadwater Farm\nYouth Association - was formed in order to face these massive\nproblems.\nTHE YOUTH ASSOCIATION\n2.31 Having noticed that many people at the Youth Association\nwere young adult men, we asked, who is a youth? Stafford Scott gave\na reply which reveals much about being unemployed in Britain\ntoday:-\n\"When we say youth, this is funny because most of them are not\nreally youths in the conventional use of the term. They are actually\nyoung men, some of them well into adulthood, but because they\nare not in employment, because they don't have total control of\ntheir future, they don't really see themselves as being men in the\nconventional use of the term. They allow themselves to be called\nyouth because they believe they are in a kind of transitional\nperiod.\"\nThe Youth Association, he explained, had catered for people from\neight years old right up to 30.\n2.32 The events which sparked off the Youth Association started\nwith a meeting called by the Tenants' Association to discuss the\nincreased number of burglaries on the estate. About 20 people were\nthere. Only one or two of them were Black. Councillor Bernie Grant\nwas in the chair. People were complaining about the time which it\ntook to get the police in. Community worker Malcolm Sargison\nsuggested that if there were a small police sub-office on the estate, the\npolice could come straight in when needed, and be accountable to the\ncommunity. The proposal was well supported by the tenants, although\nthe police did not think it would be helpful. Councillor Grant recalled\nhis reaction from the chair:-\n\"I said that the meeting was not representative, and I wanted to\n24\nhear the views of the Black residents on the estate, before I could\nagree to such a move.\"\nMalcolm Sargison wrote up a minute suggesting that the council\nwould support the mini police station idea. The Tottenham Herald\npicked up the story, and stated that Councillor Grant was in favour.\n2.33 Dolly Kiffin recalled her response:-\n\"My son bought a newspaper article saying 'Mini police station for\nBroadwater Farm' And that was when I talked to the youths. It\nwasn't very hard to talk to youths because they were always in the\ncorridors and on the precinct in Tangmere, hanging about there\nfrom day to day. I called a meeting in my front room.... You have\nto go around to ask how would they feel, would they be happy with\nit or not? Or would they rather to have a centre where they can\nplay a part, and to see if life could be changed on the Broadwater\nFarm? And that was when they said they rather to get together and\nstart up a centre of themselves and work together on it.\"\nClasford Sterling, Vice President of the Youth Association, described\nthe spirit of the early meetings:-\n\"The concerned people in the community came together and said:\n'What you really need is some resources and facilities'. And that is\nhow the Youth Association actually started. It came about to prove\nthe point, that if the community were involved in the decision\nmaking around their lives, they would actually have a better\ncommunity to live in.\"\n2.34 Barry Simons, then Director of the Mid-Tottenham Housing.\nOffice, recalls the first meeting with the new association:-\n\"There must have been 30. Dolly was there, but they were largely\nyouths and all Black. They really went for the council. I got a\nsignificant lot of heat put on me. They talked about not having\naccess to the social club, the Tenants' Association being a White\nassociation, and the police station. And their need for youth\nfacilities on the estate. And they said to me: 'We want the fish and\nchip shop'.\"\n2.35 The fish and chip shop was an unused shop on the Tangmere\nprecinct. Barry Simons had decided in his own mind that it was\nessential to meet the aspirations which the youths had expressed. He\nwas able to get the necessary approval from the committee chairs and\ncut through the bureaucratic red tape. The shop was open for use by\n25",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHE ESTATE AND ITS PEOPLE\nthe Youth Association within three weeks.\n2.36 There was no heating in the shop and it was filthy. The youths\ngot together and scrubbed it out. Dolly Kiffin went around and\nbegged for things to put into it. Malcolm Sargison helped to find them\nsome chairs, a cooker, fridge and typewriter. For Christmas 1981,\nDolly Kiffin cooked a meal in her flat and brought it downstairs:-\n\"It was so cold some of the youths caught cold in that little place.\nBut the atmosphere was good and you could see the determination\nin them.\"\n2.37 In the view of Howard Simmons, who was then Principal\nCommunity Development Officer, the opening of the Youth\nAssociation premises was \"a major symbolic base of achievement\".\nThe youth could see that their influence was actually delivering the\ngoods, that the council were responding. But in some quarters there\nwas discontent. Malcolm Sargison felt that the decision had been\nrailroaded:-\n\"For years the Tenants' Association and other people on the estate\nhad negotiated with the council in various guises, and they had\nnever been forthcoming with anything. Suddenly the chip shop was\nturned over in a fortnight. No tenants on the estate had been\nconsulted. For me that really harmed relationships on the estate.\"\n2.38 Within a short time the Youth Association had taken an\ninitiative which demonstrated their desire to make links across the\nwhole community. They began serving meals and arranging outings\nfor pensioners on the estate, and have continued ever since. Today,\n60-70 pensioners are involved, some getting meals in their homes,\nsome coming to the Youth Association for lunch. Dolly Kiffin\nexplained how it started:-\n\"The older pensioners was afraid of the youths. They would hold\ntheir bags underneath their arms and you could see they were\nfrightened. So we called a meeting and we said, it's time that with\nthe little money that we was making, we have outings for them,\nparties to take them out of their home. And that built up closer\nlinks and more understanding between the pensioners and the\nyouths. And that was the greatest achievement, I think, for us on\nthe Broadwater Farm.\".\n2.39 Many people on the estate paid tribute to this work. For\n26\nRussell Simper, the estate supervisor:-\n\"It's a thing I never thought I would see, the elderly people going\ninto the youth club in Tangmere. But they do and they enjoy it,\nand there are always compliments regarding their meals.\"\nAndy Sansom, a caretaker on the estate for seven years, said:-\n\"Before the club you had the youth doing their thing and you had\nold age pensioners going down to the social club for their dinners,\nand they never mixed. They wouldn't know each other if they fell\nover. Now some of the older people are going into the club, they\ncan see the youths. They can be boisterous, but they will hold the\nchair for them. And they get to know that they are not yobbos,\nthey are just people.\"\nA lady whom we interviewed, well into her 80's, who had been.\nknocked unconscious on the estate some years ago by an unknown\nattacker, happily goes to the Youth Association for lunch every day.\nShe looks forward to it very much because she meets so many of her\nfriends. She spoke warmly about the Christmas functions. Even in the\nweek after 6th October, when the Youth Association was ringed with\npolice officers, the pensioners still came in.\n2.40 When it started, the leaders of the Youth Association had no\nidea how to deal with the council system or apply for grants and keep\ndetailed accounts. There was little enough money - a £300 grant from\nthe council at the beginning, and contributions from the pockets of\nthe members. Gradually they became aware of the various funding\nsources and how to deal with them - the council, the Urban Aid\nprogramme and the Greater London Council. The fish and chip shop\nwas far too small, and an application was made for Urban Aid funding\nto convert a derelict shop in the corner of the precinct. Sir George\nYoung gave personal support to this initiative, and the new premises\nwere opened in 1984.\n2.41 In 1982 the Youth Association was pressed for space for a day\nnursery for young children. They had been looking at the hostel in\nWillan Road run by Social Services, for older children in care. It was\nunder used, with only three or four teenagers living in it. The Chief\nExecutive, Roy Limb recalls how he was approached by Dolly Kiffin\nand her colleagues. They wanted it for single women who had\nchildren and could not get out:-\n\"They were quite determined about it. My little bit in it was to try\nand create a climate of opinion to overcome the resistance that\n27",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nточня\nTHE ESTATE AND ITS PEOPLE\nobviously existed within the bureaucracy. It was not the normal\nthing to do in those days, handing over this professional institution\nto unpaid volunteers. I told some minor white lies like saying, well\nit was only a temporary thing. I knew damned well that once Dolly\nKiffin got her hands on it we would never get it back.\"\n2.42 The Willan Road premises became a day nursery on the ground\nfloor providing for 25 children on the estate. In 1984 the mothers'\nproject started on the upper floor, (funded by the Greater London\nCouncil), providing a shopping centre for women, a library, activity\nrooms for women's groups, and a range of activities including keep fit\nsessions, crafts, English classes, advice sessions, and a Turkish\nwomen's group. Joanne George worked with the team which set up\nthe Willan Road nursery, recruiting staff, getting equipment etc:-\n\"In general a lot of women were very isolated, just fed up, because\nof many reasons, because of poverty, because of unemployment,\nbecause of bad housing conditions, because of having nowhere to\ngo. The general feeling was: 'We are fed up now, this is the last\nstraw, we want something better for us and for our children.'\nBecoming involved changed the lives of many young people.\"\nAs the Youth Association premises on Tangmere were frequented\nmainly by men, the Willan Road building was very necessary for the\nneeds of women. By October 1985 about 50 women came to the\nmothers' project everyday, both from the estate and surrounding\nstreets.\n2.43 The other valuable new facility for children, and thus for\nparents also, is the play centre, located to the north of the Kenley\nblock. It was opened in 1984 and caters for children from five to 11\nafter school and during school holidays. Children are picked up from\nschool and stay at the centre until they can be collected by their\nparents around 5.30 pm. Around 40 children attend up to 100 in the\nholidays. It is financed by the council as another response to the\ndemands which were being voiced for proper facilities for families on\nthe estate.\n-\n2.44 Every summer the Youth Association has organised a festival\non the Lordship Recreation Ground a mixture of music, dance,\nfashion, stalls, sports and side shows, all with an African/Caribbean\nflavour. It has become a major local event with a carnival\n28\natmosphere. The Youth Association organised a number of stewards\nwith special T-shirts to ensure that nothing went wrong, and\npersuaded the police to keep in the background. The press reported it\nwith headlines such as 'FUN DAY DOWN AT THE FARM'. Many\nwitnesses spoke of the good feelings which the festival had generated:\n\"It's a time to enjoy, a time to reflect on the whole work we have\ndone over the year.\" (Clasford Sterling)\n\"It is a festival that is aimed at bringing together the community,\nand allowing the community to understand each other's culture.\"\n(Stafford Scott)\n2.45 The formation of the Youth Association led to major changes\nin the composition of the Tenants' Association. A new committee was\nvoted in with an equal number of Black and White members. A new\nconstitution was adopted, with a system of representatives on each\nblock on the estate.\n2.46 Finally, the Youth Association set up a number of co-operative\nenterprises; a community launderette, a food and vegetable co-\noperative, a hairdressing salon, a photographic workshop, and a\nsewing workshop. In late 1985 a co-operative development worker\nwas appointed with funds from the GLC, now taken over by the\nHaringey Council. All of the co-operative's projects continue to\nfunction, although some are in difficulty. We return at the end of the\nreport to the needs for the future in this field.\n2.47 The achievements of the Youth Association in under five years\nhave been remarkable. They have succeeded against all the odds.\nThey lived in a depressed and divided estate, and they brought to it\nco-operation and real benefits. They faced the massive unemployment\nof young people on the estate, and provided for them activity and a\nnumber of real jobs. They have been true to their motto \"Success\nThrough Caring\". Their efforts were deservedly recognised when in\nFebruary 1985, they were rung directly from Buckingham Palace and\nasked if they would welcome the Princess of Wales.\nTHE COUNCIL RESPONDS\n2.48 The Youth Association had been formed at the right time. The\ncouncil was already moving towards policies of real consultation with\nlocal people. Its Community Affairs Department was formed in 1982,\nin order to make the council's services more community orientated\n29",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHE ESTATE AND ITS PEOPLE\nand responsive, more accessible to the wide range of interests and\nneeds within the borough. The Housing Department was moving its\nservices into more accessible local offices. The revival of Broadwater\nFarm has therefore been a partnership of a community eager to work\nhard for change joined with a council which in many of its\ndepartments was changing also.\n2.49 A number of concrete decisions were made in the 1980s to\nbring council services into a closer physical and co-operative\nrelationship with the people of Broadwater Farm:-\n(1) In 1981 the Mid-Tottenham Housing Office was set up,\ncombining management and repair teams, and with a priority to\nrespond to the complaints of tenants on the estate. We have\ndescribed the prompt action of its senior officer over the Youth\nAssociation request for premises.\n(2) In 1982 an estate based repairs team was established, which\nnow completes 90% of its jobs within the targeted time limits - by\nfar the best performance in the borough.\n(3) In 1983 the Broadwater Farm neighbourhood office was\nopened on the Tangmere precinct. It provides for management and\nrepair services and housing benefit claims. It is the base for the two\ncommunity workers, and since October 1985 for a team of social\nworkers. It will soon have a five person team from the Building\nDesign Service to study building defects, consult over and plan a\nbuilding strategy, and oversee new building projects.\n(4) In 1984 the Broadwater Farm Panel was set up as a sub-\ncommittee of the council, chaired by Councillor Bernie Grant, to\nbring together the council, the Tenants' Association, the Youth\nAssociation, and other agencies into discussion and decision\nmaking on issues of concern to the estate.\n2.50 Neale Coleman of the neighbourhood office, spoke of an\natmosphere of co-operation between housing staff and tenants which\nastonished some visitors to the estate:-\n\"As you know, our office is completely open plan in its reception\narea, and we've often had people come from other boroughs who\nhave been asking us: 'How do you manage without thick plate glass\nscreens to hide you from the public?' We have never had problems\nof that nature in dealing with the public in the office.\"\nBut he stressed the difficulties of getting other council officers in other\n30\ndepartments who were accustomed to a rigid departmental hierarchy,\nto be accountable to local meetings as well as to their departmental\nsuperiors:-\n\"It was necessary for us to establish very firmly the principle that all\nservices would report regularly at every meeting of the Broadwater\nFarm Panel. That was important because it provided a focus of\naccountability which people could key into. We are making more\nprogress there, but it is still a difficult area.\"\n2.51 To ease the problems of co-ordination, an Inter-Agency\nWorking Party meets regularly under the chair of the neighbourhood\nofficer. A meeting attended by one of the Inquiry panel, included\nrepresentatives of eight local authority departments and several local\ngroups.\nThe meeting dealt with a very large amount of material in two\nhours. People were clearly working with co-ordination, and were used.\nto members of the local community being actively involved, both in\ncriticising and supporting what they had to do and say.\n2.52 Community leaders recognised that these changes were a real\nattempt to respond to community needs. As Dolly Kiffin put it:-\n\"Councillors must get off their backsides and come and see the\ncommunity before they sign anything. Officers cannot just come\nand write a report to the council unless they now consult the\ncommunity. That's what we do on Broadwater Farm and that's\nwhat we changed.\"\nLeonardo Leon, Treasurer of the Tenants' Association, drew a\ndistinction between the council as an institution and the\nneighbourhood office:\n\"We have a really good working relationship with the\nneighbourhood office. Most of the officers there have been working\nwith us and helping us to develop our initiatives but at the same\ntime we have met some difficulties when we go higher and have to\ndeal with the chairs of committees, or whoever is involved at the\nhigher level.\"\n2.53 The new partnership between council and community produced\na number of concrete results. In a million-pound maintenance\nprogramme all broken windows, woodwork and communal glazing\nwere repaired or replaced, and the exterior redecorated. Major steps\nwere taken to improve security and prevent crime. Entry phones were\n31",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHE ESTATE AND ITS PEOPLE\ninstalled in the two tower blocks: the flimsy front doors to the flats\nwere renewed and strengthened with metal plates. The areas around\nthe bottom of the blocks, where thieves used to hide, were opened\nup.\n2.54 Neale Coleman described how the changes were made:-\n\"We talked to the local crime prevention officer. We talked to\ntenants in a number of blocks in an intensive way and the initial\nchange that we made was to replace all the front doors with solid.\ncore doors. We strengthened the frames by lining the frames with\nsteel and providing a mortice lock that locked into the steel-\nreinforced frame. And on the other side of the door, the new doors\nhad metal hinge bolts. And our experience was that this made an\nimmediate effect, a dramatic effect on burglaries.\"\nHowever there was still a problem because the area around the lock\nwas a point of weakness, and some burglars were able to push the\nlock through the door with a hard blow. Neale Coleman continued:-\n\"So again we talked to the police and we talked to tenants and we\ntalked to community groups and we came up with the solution of\nfitting two steel plates bolted through to sandwich that part of the\ndoor together and give it extra strength. We carried out that work\nagain across all the flats on the estate. And since then the burglary\nrate has again been very, very low indeed, as is accepted by the\npolice. It is far lower than for the rest of Tottenham.\"\n2.55 Tricia Zipfel, who had studied the estate for some years on\nbehalf of the Department of the Environment, summed up the\nachievements in a report to the Department in October 1985:-\n\"(The Estate) had become a training model for the Priority Estates\nProject, hosting visitors from estates all over the country. The\nneighbourhood office was dealing with over 900 queries from\ntenants each month, the refusal rate had been halved, more tenants\nwere choosing to live on the estate, repairs were being done faster\nthan in the rest of the borough. Voids had dropped from around 60\nto 15, and the atmosphere and quality of service in the\nneighbourhood office was excellent. The estate was clean, there\nwas very little graffiti or vandalism. Also, and perhaps most\nsignificantly, crime on the estate had plummeted. The police have\nacknowledged that burglaries on Broadwater Farm were lower than\nin the rest of Y district. Visits to the estate by Princess Diana and\n32\nSir George Young boosted the confidence and morale of workers\nand tenants alike.\"\nIn the evidence to us she provided a graphic illustration of the\nchange:-blo\n\"When the D.O.E. investigators went on to the estate in 1978,\nthere wasn't a single pane of communal glass intact. The whole\nplace was littered with broken glass. By 1983 - 84 when I was on\nthe estate, there wasn't a single pane of communal glass that was\nnot intact. There was no broken glass on the estate anywhere.'\n2.56\nCouncil officers give credit to the Youth Association, and to\nDolly Kiffin in particular, for the turnaround that has taken place.\nThe Chief Executive Roy Limb said:-\n\"The dynamism and enthusiasm of Dolly Kiffin has had everything\nto do with the way in which progress has been made on Broadwater\nFarm Estate.\"\nAn elderly resident echoed his words:-\n\"Well I don't know who this Miss Dolly is, but she has worked\nwonders for this estate.\"\nWe too praise Dolly Kiffin, but we would emphasise that she was\nnot alone. Many people have made a wrong assumption that Dolly\nKiffin was the only leader of the Youth Association - an assumption\nwhich led to serious consequences in the summer of 1985, as we shall\ndescribe. In reality there has been an extremely able and dedicated\nteam of young people, both men and women, Black people and\nWhite, working for the Youth Association from the start.\n2.57 In the 1980s the pattern of press reporting began to change.\nThere were still a number of negative reports; but people in the\ncommunity were now more organised, and able to insist that reporters\nfrom the local newspapers came down and reported in full on the\npositive achievements of the estate. On 14th October 1982 the\n'Weekly Herald' had on its front page published an article headed\n\"CALL FOR SLUM CLEARANCE SCHEME\", in which a councillor\nwas reported as saying that Broadwater Farm and some other estates\nshould be pulled down. In the following week the newspaper printed a\nfull page \"news probe\" headed \"BROADWATER FARM - WHAT IS\nITS FUTURE? TENANTS INJECT NEW LIFE.\" The report featured\nthe projects of the Youth Association and also about the tensions\nbetween youths and the police. There was a similar sequence of\narticles in November 1984. After a leaked report by a social services\n33",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nofficer had been published in which it was claimed that home helps\nwere scared to go on the estate, Dolly Kiffin contacted the paper\nexpressing anger at the report. The result was a full page report about\nthe Youth Association and in particular its work for old people. A\nleading article said:-\n\"Broadwater now offers a community life to old and young alike,\nespecially to the unemployed with time on their hands. Not only\nthat: those who are housebound get hot dinners delivered by young\nvolunteers.\"\n2.58 While the success has been remarkable, it is important to\nrecognise that the Youth Association has many obstacles still to\novercome. As we show from the analysis of the survey in Chapter 7,\nthe estate is not a fully integrated community. Many people praised\nthe work of the Youth Association and other new organisations, but\nfew are actually involved in them. There are sections of the estate that\ndo not feel that the Youth Association caters for their needs. There\nhave been considerable improvements in the housing field, but in\nother areas, such as education and economic development, the\nparticipation of the community has scarcely begun. We return in\nChapter 9 to consider various ways forward for the future. We now\nturn to consider how the various ranks of the Metropolitan Police\nresponded to the community of Broadwater Farm.\nDe\n20 planoq sudahpa vilagon to admin a line now mo\nbaden\nbilt Chapter 3\nTHE POLICE AND THE COMMUNITY\nTHE BACKGROUND OF INJUSTICE\n3.1 Black people who settled in Britain in the 1950s and early 1960s.\nwere strongly supportive of the police. But over the 1970s, as a\ngeneration of Black people born in Britain grew up, the attitudes of\ntheir parents to the police changed dramatically. The change came\nabout because they saw what was happening to their sons and\ndaughters. They saw them picked on in stop-and-search operations\nand arrests under \"Sus\". When they complained to the police, whom\nthey believed to be the protectors of the law, they were rebuffed and\nsometimes mistreated. And when they complained they were not\ntaken seriously.\nMrs Scott, the mother of five children, told us how her experience\nchanged:-\n\"In the sixties I was quite friendly with the police. We had a club\non the Bruce Grove Road. I can't remember the name there is a\nhairdresser's there now. And we used to gamble there and the\npolice officers from Tottenham used to be there. We used to know\nand call each other by our first names. And sometimes when I'd get\nbroke I would turn to one and say: 'I'm skint, have you got any\nmoney?' And they would turn to me the same way. It suddenly\nchanged in the early seventies. It seemed as if all the decent police\nofficers had left the area and there were all different people coming\nin. And you couldn't go to the police and make a complaint without\nbeing harassed. Although you are making a complaint, you are\nbeing harassed by the police.\nMr Jarrett described to us an incident in 1977 when he asked for the\nhelp of the police to deal with a boy breaking his windows, and ended\nup being arrested himself. He concluded:-\n\"These are all things which you have to look into. How much can\nyou trust the police when you need help? There are several West\nIndian families who have gone to the police for help and been\nturned down flat.\"\n34\n35"

            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHO\nofficer had been published in which it was claimed that home helps\nwere scared to go on the estate, Dolly Kiffin contacted the paper\nexpressing anger at the report. The result was a full page report about\nthe Youth Association and in particular its work for old people. A\nleading article said:-\n\"Broadwater now offers a community life to old and young alike,\nespecially to the unemployed with time on their hands. Not only\nthat: those who are housebound get hot dinners delivered by young\nvolunteers.\"\nwith\n2.58 While the success has been remarkable, it is important to\nrecognise that the Youth Association has many obstacles still to\novercome. As we show from the analysis of the survey in Chapter 7,\nthe estate is not a fully integrated community. Many people praised\nthe work of the Youth Association and other new organisations, but\nfew are actually involved in them. There are sections of the estate that\ndo not feel that the Youth Association caters for their needs. There\nhave been considerable improvements in the housing field, but in\nother areas, such as education and economic development, the\nparticipation of the community has scarcely begun. We return in\nChapter 9 to consider various ways forward for the future. We now\nturn to consider how the various ranks of the Metropolitan Police\nresponded to the community of Broadwater Farm.\nad\nChapter 3\nTHE POLICE AND THE COMMUNITY\nTHE BACKGROUND OF INJUSTICE\n3.1 Black people who settled in Britain in the 1950s and early 1960s\nwere strongly supportive of the police. But over the 1970s, as a\ngeneration of Black people born in Britain grew up, the attitudes of\ntheir parents to the police changed dramatically. The change came\nabout because they saw what was happening to their sons and\ndaughters. They saw them picked on in stop-and-search operations\nand arrests under \"Sus\". When they complained to the police, whom\nthey believed to be the protectors of the law, they were rebuffed and\nsometimes mistreated. And when they complained they were not\ntaken seriously.\nMrs Scott, the mother of five children, told us how her experience\nchanged:-\n\"In the sixties I was quite friendly with the police. We had a club\non the Bruce Grove Road. I can't remember the name - there is a\nhairdresser's there now. And we used to gamble there and the\npolice officers from Tottenham used to be there. We used to know\nand call each other by our first names. And sometimes when I'd get\nbroke I would turn to one and say: 'I'm skint, have you got any\nmoney?' And they would turn to me the same way. It suddenly\nchanged in the early seventies. It seemed as if all the decent police\nofficers had left the area and there were all different people coming\nin. And you couldn't go to the police and make a complaint without\nbeing harassed. Although you are making a complaint, you are\nbeing harassed by the police.\"\nMr Jarrett described to us an incident in 1977 when he asked for the\nhelp of the police to deal with a boy breaking his windows, and ended\nup being arrested himself. He concluded:-\n\"These are all things which you have to look into. How much can\nyou trust the police when you need help? There are several West\nIndian families who have gone to the police for help and been\nturned down flat.\"\n34\n35",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\n3.2 The pages of Haringey press show that throughout the 1970s\nthere was mounting concern about the behaviour of police officers to\nBlack people in Tottenham. In August 1973 a meeting was held at the\nCivic Centre, chaired by the Mayor, to \"ease strained relations\nbetween the police and the Black community\". Bitter criticism of\nvarious aspects of police behaviour was voiced. The meeting launched\na voluntary liaison scheme, organised by the Haringey Council for\nCommunity Relations, under which volunteers could be called into\npolice stations in cases of difficulty.\nIT\n3.3 In July 1975 there was an outraged reaction to the conviction of\na Black sixth-form student for assaulting a police officer. Many\nwitnesses had testified in court that police officers assaulted him. A\nreporter on the Hornsey Journal analysed the background of the case\nand concluded:-\n\"There must be a thorough investigation of the general complaints\nbeing made against the police, and action taken to see that the\nBlack community have confidence in them. Anything less would be\na whitewash, with untold consequences in a multi-racial society\".\nConcern about the crisis in police/community relations crossed\nparty lines. At a meeting in the same month, a Conservative\ncouncillor, Robert Atkins, said:-\n\"There are frightening indications of a sudden and serious\ndeterioration in relations between the immigrant community and\nthe police.\"\n3.4 In January 1978, a Labour Party inquiry was set up into racism\nand discrimination against Black people in the borough. The inquiry\nhad been called for by the Tony Anderson Campaign - a campaign to\nexpose police harassment of one Black youth, whose case was said by\nthe inquiry chairman to be \"the tip of the iceberg\". Dolly Kiffin is\nTony Anderson's mother, and she told us of her own response when\nher son came home and said the police had punched him:-\n\"I just grab him and take him down to the police station and\ndemand: 'This police punched my son and I want justice'. Because\nalthough you read about it, you don't know this, don't believe that\nthese things happen, because you believe they are supposed to keep\nthe law. I personally did not realise that they break the law.\"\n3.5 Witness after witness to our Inquiry spoke of the indignities\nwhich they have suffered at the hands of police officers for no other\n36\nтяо\nTHE POLICE AND THE COMMUNITY\nreason than that they were Black. The bitterness of their experience\nwas shared by old and young, men and women, professional people\nand unemployed:-\n\"I have never been unemployed. I have a reasonable standard of\nliving. However as a Black person individually, it's been my\ncommon experience to be stopped, searched, questioned by the\npolice, and treated with suspicion and hostility.\" (Michael\nHutchinson-Reis, social worker).\n\"I have had my toes stepped on, I have been backed into corners,\npolicemen have spoken to me with a filthy mouth full of spit. I have\nstepped out of that and I have handled the situation, but I can see\nthat young people can't keep their patience, and quite a lot of the\ntimes they have exploited that, and then they get a hammering and\na hiding.\" (Norton McLean, Principal Youth Officer).\n\"They stopped me by St. Paul's cathedral once, twice in one night.\nTwo different lots of police. They said: 'Well what are you doing in\nSt. Paul's? We don't usually see Black people in St. Paul's.' So I\nasked him: 'Is that the only reason why they stop me, just because\nI'm Black and in St. Pauls?', and they said: 'Yes'. At which point I\ngot a bit angry, because I thought that was a fucking insult\" (young\nBlack man).\nIt is because of experiences like this that people so often get\ncharged for what are called \"knock-on offences\"; they get stopped,\nsearched or arrested for a reason which turns out to have no\nfoundation, but are then charged with some other offence\nobstructing or assaulting the police, or threatening behaviour which\nhas arisen only because of the contact between the \"suspect\" and the\npolice.\n3.6 There should be no surprise at this evidence. Throughout the\n1970s there were reports written and inquiries made into the\nmaltreatment of Black people by the police. Finally in 1981, the\nevidence was brought before the official inquiry made by Lord\nScarman into the Brixton disorders. Lord Scarman said of the\nevidence of which he had heard:-\n\"Whether justified or not, many in Brixton believe that the police\nroutinely abuse their powers and mistreat alleged offenders. The\nbelief here is as important as the fact. One of the most serious\ndevelopments in recent years, has been the way in which the older\ngeneration of Black people in Brixton has come to share the belief\n37",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHE POLICE AND THE COMMUNITY\nof the younger generation, that the police routinely harass and\nill-treat black youngsters\".\n-\n3.7 We differ in one central respect from the conclusion of Lord\nScarman. It deliberately avoided the central question\nwas the\n\"belief\" of Black people based on fact or fiction? The belief is not \"as\nimportant as the fact\"; it is the fact which is supremely important. If\nthe belief of Black people was based on fact, it meant that great\nnumbers of Metropolitan Police officers were racist in their thoughts\nand actions. If the belief was based on fiction, it meant that Black\npeople were being over-credulous and were naively accepting\nunfounded rumour. From the mass of reported evidence, which was\navailable to Lord Scarman, we have no doubt that the conclusions of\nBlack people were deeply grounded on true experience of racially\nprejudiced police behaviour.\n1981 THE CHANCE FOR A NEW START\n3.8 In 1981, the year of the Brixton and Toxteth disturbances, the\nBorough of Haringey had also experienced confrontations between\npolice and people. On Easter Monday there had been a brief but\nviolent clash at the Finsbury Park funfair. Commander Dickinson, the\nhead of Y district which covered the boroughs of Haringey and\nEnfield, suffered a broken nose and a fractured cheek bone. The\nHornsey Journal carried an emotive report:-\n-\n\"They did it again. About 500 Black youths stampeded the\nFinsbury Park funfair last Monday - as they did last year and\nterrified the mixed race groups, who until then, were happily\nmingling on the swings and roundabouts. And today people in\nHaringey are asking: \"WHO IS GOING TO STOP THESE\nRIOTS?\"\nOn 7th July shop windows were broken and missiles thrown at the\npolice in the Wood Green High Road. It was reported that 59 shops\nhad been damaged or looted, and 8 police officers injured.\n3.9 The publication of the Scarman report in November 1981 offered\nto all the chance of a fresh start. Lord Scarman had made a series of\nrecommendations to deal with the crisis in police/community\nrelations: action against racist behaviour by police officers,\nimprovements in police training, compulsory in-service courses, close\nsupervision of stop-and-search operations, and a setting up of\nimmediate consultative arrangements, in advance of a statutory\n38\nscheme. In Brixton immediate steps were taken to bring in a new\nleadership to the police force which was prepared to carry through the\nScarman proposals. Such leadership was desperately needed in\nTottenham.\nTHE POLICE AND THE YOUTH ASSOCIATION\n3.10 On Broadwater Farm, the newly formed Youth Association\nwas ready and willing to enter into dialogue with the police, and at\nsome levels, at least, the police were ready and willing to enter into\ndialogue with the Youth Association. It is central to our Inquiry to\ndiscover why the dialogue failed to develop trust and confidence\nbetween the police and people on the estate.\n3.11 At a certain level, the contact was close. Three officers in\nparticular came frequently to the Youth Association office in the\nperiod between 1982 and 1985:\nChief Superintendent Couch, the officer in charge of the\nTottenham division from 1984, and a man generally recognised to\nhave been committed to community policing. We will have to examine\nhow he interpreted the concept of \"community policing\", and whether\nhe operated it effectively. But we have no doubt that he genuinely\nwanted to work in collaboration with local community leaders.\nChief Inspector (later Superintendent) Dick Stacey, the\nCommunity Liaison Officer, and a man who also made great efforts to\nbe available for meetings with local people. Councillor Martha\nOsamor, who has been prominent in campaigns against police abuses\nin Tottenham for many years, said of him:- basagn\n-\n\"We don't see them all as bad people, wicked people. There's some\ngood ones. Inspector Stacey was one of those that we could rely on,\ncall him day and night and he will visit the families.\"\nInspector Paul Gee, who worked as Superintendent Stacey's\nassistant in community liaison work.\n3.12 On the side of the Youth Association, there was also a desire\nfor co-operation. A football match was played between the\nBroadwater Farm team and a team from Tottenham Police station.\nPolice had an open door invitation to come into the Youth\nAssociation Office. High ranking officers from abroad, such as\nSuperintendent Henry De Geneste of the New Jersey police, were\nentertained for lunch. The accusation made by D.A.C Richards that\n\"normal policing methods are resisted by a vociferous minority” — an\n39\n-",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTROL\nTHE POLICE AND THE COMMUNITY\naccusation which is plainly levelled against Youth Association leaders\nis preposterous. Indeed it is completely belied by Chief\nSuperintendent Couch's words in a television interview after the\ndisturbances:-\n\"Up till about June of this year, the Broadwater Farm Estate was a\npleasant place to work on for our police officers. In fact, they said\nyou really don't need so many of us any more. And things were\nworking very well. And we worked in good co-operation with the\nhousing department, and with Miss Kiffin, who was on the\nBroadwater Youth Association.\"\n(The London Programme, 11th October, 1985)\n3.13 The problem was that the constructive ideas discussed at\nmeetings with Messrs Couch, Stacey, and Gee were not translated\ninto reality. There were two areas of difficulty. First, the local\ncommand appeared to have no control over the activities of special\nunits such as the Special Patrol Group and the instant response units.\nAttempts at building good relations were regularly set back by the\ninsensitive and unnecessary actions of these units which enraged local\nyouths. Haringey's Chief Executive, Roy Limb, who helped to\narrange many of the meetings, described what used to happen:-\n\"It did seem to us that when we had had a good meeting and things\nwere going quite well, all of a sudden there would be another\nincident on Broadwater Farm and that would damage the\nrelationships. Now I still don't believe in the conspiracy theory, but\nI do actually accept that these incidents occurred. On one occasion,\nit had all been agreed that 15 youngsters were going to go over to\nHendon (the police training college) and have a look at what goes\non there, and be really straight with policemen about police-youth\nrelationships. That had all been arranged for a Saturday morning,\nand the police were to provide the van. Sure enough, as God made\nlittle apples, on the Friday an instant response unit came screeching\ndown onto the estate. Out leapt policemen and a number of youths\nwere detained, questioned and so on, and sure enough that was the\nend of the visit to Hendon.\"\n3.14 The second difficulty was that the Youth Association wanted,\nabove all, to build a co-operative relationship with the regular\npatrolling officers on the estate, who had been increased into a team.\nof eight. But this never happened, except briefly when a young Black\nwoman officer joined the team.\n40\nAs one witness said: \"There was a lot of ribbing and she accepted that\nand at the end of the day there was some kind of vibes between her\nand the youth.\" But to everyone's annoyance she was transferred\nafter a few weeks. The police said that she needed to continue her\ntraining elsewhere, but many took it as evidence that good community\nrelations at rank and file level were not to be encouraged.\n3.15 Stafford Scott, a youth worker with the Youth Association,\ngave a vivid picture of how the Association pressed for contact with\npatrolling officers, only to be confronted with two men who plainly\nhad no intention of being community policemen:-\nCC\n'Although we had what at times seemed to be very good meetings\nwith senior police officers, what we found was, in the day to day\nrelationships with the beat officers, there was no change. At one\nstage we actually had to demand that they come and visit the Youth\nAssociation. We told them: 'You do not need to phone; come in\nand see what we are up to; come in and play pool with us, come in\nand talk to the members'.\"\nQuestion from Panel:-\n\"Has that ever been done?\"\n-\n\"The first time it ever happened, we had Billy the Kid and the Sun\nDance Kid anyway they were cowboys. They actually kicked\nopen the Youth Association's door and stood with hands on hips\nholding truncheons, and they just looked in, in a very aggressive\nand antagonistic manner.\"\nNeale Coleman, who as Neighbourhood Officer had regular dealings\nwith the patrolling officers, confirms:-\n\"It was certainly my impression that the complaints that the Youth\nAssociation made about a comparative lack of response from the\npatrolling officers to invitations to come into the centre, to become\ninvolved, were, by and large, justified. Obviously there were other\npressures on those officers, other tasks that they had to carry out,\nbut I think it is fair to say that not very much progress was made in\nestablishing links between the patrolling officers and the\ncommmunity as a whole.\"\n3.16 If proof were needed of the failure of the patrolling officers to\nrelate to local organisations, it came from a remarkable piece of\nevidence provided by Tricia Zipfel. She had attended a meeting with\npolice officers on 1st October 1985. Present were Chief\nSuperintendent Couch, his deputy, Inspector Sinclair, and Sergeant\n41",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nGillian Meynell, who was in charge of the Broadwater Farm home\nbeat team. Tricia Zipfel's record of the meeting states:-\n\"A further significant point emerging in our discussions was the fact\nthat, although very committed to community policing, the sergeant\nwho had been in charge of the home beat team since May 1985, had\nrarely been on the estate and had never met with Dolly Kiffin or\nany other key people. In fact, she stated that she and the home\nbeat officers were not allowed to meet with community groups.\"\n3.17 We find it quite deplorable that the police officer in charge of\nthe patrolling team should make no effort to meet key people on the\nestate especially during a period in which, as we will see, there\nwere causes for increased tension and therefore a real need for\npolice/community understanding. As for the statement that \"she and\nthe home officers were not allowed to meet with community groups\",\nwe find it even more appalling. Tricia Zipfel felt that it was not so\nmuch an order, but an implicit assumption that the job of negotiating\nwith the community was left to senior officers, and the people on the\nground were not part of that process. We find that to be profoundly\ndisturbing. The Broadwater Farm home beat team had cut themselves\noff from any hope of co-operation with the community they were\nmeant to serve. They had and their later published reports prove it,\nas we shall see - begun to regard local people as the enemy.\n-\nA FAILURE OF LEADERSHIP\n3.18 When senior and junior officers are found to have such\nconflicting views of their role, it becomes important to look at the\nperson in overall charge, who from 1981 to May 1985, was\nCommander Dickinson. He has been mentioned by many as a man\nwho had no desire to consult seriously with local people. Ernie Large\nwas a councillor in the Bruce Grove ward until May 1986, and was\ninvolved many times in trying to improve relations between his\nconstituents and the police. He was himself a former military\npoliceman and magistrate, and not a man who would make\njudgements lightly. He gave us this view of Commander Dickinson: -\n\"He was the grey haired, old fashioned type police officer. We both\ncame from the East End. He actually had knowledge of the\ncriminals in the East End, and a kind of mutual respect. What the\nCommander could not handle was the openness of community\nrelations with the council, with its felt need to protect the\ncommunity from all injustice. In all my political life I have not\n42\nтяо\nTHE POLICE AND THE COMMUNITY\nreally had a serious argument with anybody on the council. The\nonly battles I have had have been with that particular Commander.\nI found an iron curtain came down, and every time we wanted.\nsomething, the retort was invariably, we don't have to tell you\nanything, we are only responsible up the road at the Home Office,\nand therefore we are totally separate. The insularity of the police\nvis-a-vis the community was created by the attitude of that one\nCommander. If there could have been a different type of character\nthere in terms of human relationships, he would have found that\nmoderate and left-wing Labour councillors might have been no\ndifferent to anyone else, in human terms, in getting things right for\nthe community. But there was this total blockage.\"\n3.19 Commander Dickinson was responsible for starting a petty\nminded procedure whereby, when written to by the chair of the\ncouncil's police committee, he invariably replied to someone else. In\none such letter, written on the 10th April 1985, to Mr Limb in reply to\na letter from Councillor Makanji, the contempt for the council was\nscarcely veiled:-\n\"The proposals in a letter dated 2nd April signed by a Councillor\nMakanji are not acceptable.\"\nNot surprisingly, Councillor Makanji told us that this form of reply\nwas regarded as a snub to the elected leaders of the council.\nAccording to Nick Wright, head of the Council's Police Research\nUnit, Commander Dickinson had issued an instruction to his\nsubordinates not to talk to any of the staff of the unit:-\n\"We would talk to an officer and when they found out who we\nwere, they put the phone down. That was a consistent pattern until\nApril or May of last year.\"\n3.20 As regards the Broadwater Farm Estate, Commander\nDickinson made no secret of his attitude in an interview on the \"Black\non Black\" programme, broadcast in early 1983:-\nCommander Dickinson:\n\"Certainly the crime rate as far as street crime is concerned, that's\nrobberies and mugging in the modern parlance, had gone down as\nopposed to last year, and it needs to go down because it was\nextremely high last year, but this hasn't gone down because we are\nwalking away from the problem. It's gone down because of\neffective policing that we are displaying around the area.\"\n43",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHE POLICE AND THE COMMUNITY\nInterviewer:\n\"How do you reply to the youths that say that the decrease in the\ncrime rate was because of their specific action, in other words they\nhad taken youths off the streets, provided them with some sort of\nspecial centre and so on?\"\nCommander Dickinson:\n\"Well if that is the case, if they claim that, very good, and I give\nthem great acclaim for that, but it only proves that they were\nresponsible for it in the first place, if that's what they say\".\nFor a senior officer to make such a remark, on a programme\ndesigned for a Black audience, reveals a frightening lack of\nunderstanding and sensitivity.\n3.21 We are bound to conclude that with Commander Dickinson in\ncharge, the opportunity of taking a new, post-Scarman look at police/\ncommunity relations was not on. Chief Superintendent Couch must\nhave felt himself caught between junior officers who had no sympathy\nwith his approach and a Commander who was unwilling to give him\nsupport.\n3.22 In May 1985, the reorganisation of the Metropolitan Police\ncommand structure began to take effect. The districts disappeared,\nand instead London became divided for police purposes into five\nareas, each under the command of a Deputy Assistant Commissioner.\nD.A.C. Richards took on the overall command of Area 1, a huge\nwedge of North London from the centre to the outer suburbs. He had\nlittle time before October to know much about Broadwater Farm, but\nhe appears to have adopted the negative view of his predecessor. In\nan interview on the \"Diverse Reports\" programme, broadcast on 27th\nNovember 1985, he had this to say about the estate and its people:―\n\"No, they've long since been alienated, I'm afraid. It's long been a\nhaven for the wrongdoer. It's long been the place to which people\ngo from outside to gain comfort and support from people of a like\nilk.\"\nThere are some nasty connotations to this description, which we do\nnot believe were shared by the Chief Superintendent of Tottenham,\nwho had direct knowledge of the estate and its people. It seems to\nindicate that the new top leadership was no more open-minded than\nthe old.\n44\nPOLICE ON THE ESTATE\n3.23 We turn now to the particular clashes which took place on the\nestate. Prior to 1982, a single home beat officer, PC Brian \"Ginger\"\nStratton patrolled the estate. He was liked by many residents. Russell\nSimper, now the Estate Supervisor, described him as a decent police\nofficer, dedicated to the people on the estate. But there was\ndiscontent about the problems of getting police assistance after the all\ntoo frequent burglaries and vandalism. As one resident said:-\n\"You would have a job getting a policeman if you phoned the\npolice. But when they did come, they would come in droves.\"\n3.24 The friendly attitude of PC Stratton contrasted with the\nactivities of the special units that came in from time to time. Malcolm\nSargison, community worker at the time, described the two kinds of\npolicing:-\n\"Whenever there was a spate of burglaries on the estate, they'd\nsend in the SPG and clamp down on everybody, especially Black\npeople. I could see that there was something missing in it all. We\nhad Ginger, and he was a friendly sort of chap. He didn't seem to\nrealise the effects of the SPG being sent in.\"\n3.25 A number of incidents occurred in 1982 which served to harden\nattitudes on both sides. On 12th August 1982, PC Andy Holland, who\nfive months before had joined PC Stratton as a second home beat\nofficer, was struck on the head with a bottle while inside the office of\nthe Youth Association talking to Dolly Kiffin. Dolly Kiffin agreed\nthat this happened. She explained that there had been a heavy police\npresence on the estate shortly before, but that did not excuse what\nwas done:-\n\"We called a meeting as an effect of that, because as we said at the\nmeeting, that should not ever happen. We called the meeting to say\nthat two wrongs don't make a right.\"\nPC Holland said later to the press: \"How can you talk to people\nunder those circumstances?\" It was a disgraceful incident, which must\nhave reinforced the view that the recently formed Youth Association\nwas hostile to the police.\n3.26 On the next occasion, it was the community that had cause for\nbitter complaint. Late on the evening of 1st November 1982, a group\nof police officers, with dozens more in support, ran into Tangmere\nand arrested Roger Scott, an active member of the Youth\n45",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHE POLICE AND THE COMMUNITY\nAssociation, saying that he had just burgled the Social Club. There\nwere dozens of other youths present who had been watching a film\nwith Roger and knew that he could not have done it. The Social Club\nhad been entered and messed up, though nothing had been stolen.\nThe burglar alarm had not gone off, and Youth Association officers\nare convinced that it was not a genuine burglary. The police claimed\nlater, according to the press, that they acted \"as a result from a tip\nfrom a member of the public\".\n3.27 A crowd gathered outside Tottenham Police Station. Several\nwitnesses have described to us how, because of the lack of trust in the\npolice, it has become an important community reaction when an\ninjustice is thought to have been done, for people to go to the police\nstation and to demand information. Indeed, we shall see that it was\nthis intention to make a stand at the police station itself, which\ndirectly led to confrontation with the police on 6th October. Clasford\nSterling described what happened when he reached the police station\nin the early hours of the morning after securing the Social Club:-\n\"I just found myself being dragged backwards by police. Not only\nme, but all the people that were outside the police station, which\nwere young kids, women, adult people as well. It was just\ndisgusting really. I ended up with a broken nose and charged with\nobstruction.\"\nWhat had happened was that a special unit of police in riot gear\nhappened to return to Tottenham Police Station after attending a\ndemonstration in Brixton. Seeing what they took to be trouble at the\npolice station, they lost control. Four people were arrested for\nobstruction, all of them officers or active members of the Youth\nAssociation. Two, Clasford Sterling and Diane Anderson, were\nacquitted in the Magistrates Court at their trial over a year later.\nRoger Scott was released the same night without any charge.\n3.28 This was a disgraceful case of a mishandled operation escalating\ninto violence and inflaming an already tense state of affairs. It is to\nthe credit of Clasford Sterling, who suffered a broken nose and false\ncharge, that he continued to be a highly responsible vice-president of\nthe Youth Association, seeking the maximum co-operation with the\npolice.\n3.29 On the following day, 2nd November, there were two attacks\nagainst the police, two metal beer kegs were dropped onto a police\n46\ncar off one of the overhead walk-ways. No one was hurt, but it was\nsaid afterwards that an inspector was fortunate to escape serious\ninjury. More seriously still, the home beat officer, PC Brian Stratton,\nwas struck on the head with a billiard cue while he was inside\nManston block investigating a complaint by a black woman about\nracist graffiti on her front door. There followed an immediate\nincursion onto the estate of riot police in large numbers. They\nremained for the next two days. Clasford Sterling recalled that\nperiod:-\n\"Every morning they would pull up, they would don their black\ngloves inside the van, and while they were putting on their black\ngloves they would be smiling at anyone who was around. They\nwould come upstairs and they would position themselves totally\naround the deck of Tangmere. That was the only area of the estate\nthey actually policed. They were just trying to incite and antagonise\nthe youth as far as we see it.\"\n3.30 From then on, the amount of police attention devoted to\nBroadwater Farm increased considerably. A team of eight home beat\nofficers patrolled the estate on a continuous rota. PC Stratton never\nreturned. Even before he left, secret surveillance had started from\none of the high floors in the Northolt tower block. Millard Scott told\nus:-\n\"We could identify the windows because we saw the reflection from\nthe sun on several occasions. We saw the curtain being moved and\nwhat looked like equipment being put in front of it. We have seen\npeople actually looking from out of the windows. We got binoculars\nand we looked and we saw someone with binoculars looking at us.\"\nMalcolm Sargison had been told by PC Stratton how the council\nco-operated with the police by allowing empty flats in tower blocks to\nbe used during \"surveillance weeks.\"\n3.31 Sometimes there were flare-ups, when the risk of major trouble\nwas averted by the intervention of senior people from the council,\nusually in the middle of the night: particularly Councillors Bernie\nGrant and Ernie Large, and the Chief Executive, Roy Limb, whose\nactions went far beyond the normal call of a Chief Executive's duty.\nWe heard of three incidents in particular, two caused by insensitive\npolicing and one by a criminal act. There was the case of the man who\nlaughed at the police just after Easter 1983. Two men were working\non a car. Two patrolling officers came by and one of them tripped.\n47",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHE POLICE AND THE COMMUNITY\nThe men laughed. Immediately they were questioned about the car;\nthey refused to answer; others came over to see what was happening;\nthe police called reinforcements; a van load came down, and the two\nmen were taken off to the police station. The other insensitive\nincident could be called the case of the quiet football match. In the\nspring of 1985, when Chief Superintendent Couch's approach\nappeared to be working, three vans from special units swept down\nonto the estate and spread out in a show of force. The superintendent\nexpressed his regrets at the incident, explaining that the officers had\nbeen at the Tottenham Hotspur football match where they had not\nhad enough to do.\n3.32 The criminal act, and in our view also a disgraceful incident,\nwas the stabbing of a police officer, PC Betts, on 4th August 1983.\nOfficers had gone to arrest a woman in the Manston block, a crowd\ngathered and the police radioed for assistance. In the melee which\nfollowed PC Betts was stabbed in the back. Great numbers of other\nofficers were called onto the estate. Feelings were high on both sides.\nCouncillor Bernie Grant, who arrived on the scene, was ordered to\nmove on and almost dragged from his car before Mr Limb intervened.\nMr Limb, Councillor Grant and Councillor Large then stood between\nthe residents and the police and succeeded in preventing further\ntrouble.\n3.33 The more that incidents of this kind occurred, the more they\ncreated a vicious spiral of mistrust and fear. Conservative Councillor\nAndrew Mitchell described it as a \"chicken and egg situation\", since\nin his view it became impossible to discover who was originally to\nblame. He gave this analysis:-\n\"Conversations after the riot confirmed to me that there is an\nunderstandable perception that the police do not like the youths,\nand particularly did not like the organisations which were on\nBroadwater Farm. By the same token, giving a balanced view,\nthere is a perception by the police that they cannot go to an area\nlike Broadwater Farm to carry out normal policing, without being\nin some way attacked, victimised or abused. So you start to develop\nthe chicken and egg situation. The police officers, because they are\nscared, rather than going in twos to investigate crime in the\nordinary way, start to go mob-handed. Then those that are being\ninvestigated get the feeling that they are being victimised. You\n48\nwant to say: 'Forget what's gone on in the past, let's start again and\ntreat each other normally'.\"\nWe have described above how, in our view, the leadership of\nCommander Dickinson had made it impossible to make a fresh start,\nwhich Councillor Mitchell rightly said was needed.\nCRIME ON THE ESTATE\n3.34 The sad irony is that these dangerous clashes with the police\nwere taking place over a period when crime on the estate was\ndecreasing. Figures were provided from police sources to Haringey\nCouncil's police committee, which have been often quoted and never\ndisputed by the police. The figures were for the numbers of crimes\nreported, which occurred in or near the 12 residential blocks on\nBroadwater Farm Estate, during each six month period from June to\nNovember, from 1982-1985 (except that in 1985 the period taken was\nfrom June to October).\nYear\nVehicle Beat\nCrime\n33535\nCrime\nMajor Robbery Burglary TOTAL\nCrime\n1982\n103\n44\n34\n13\n72\n266\n1983\n122\n59\n68\n34\n418\n1984\n66\n35\n11\n21\n40\n173\n1985\n48\n31\n22\n30\n30\n161\nRate of\nincrease\n32%\n63%\n8%\n62%\n50%\n1982-3 50%\nCompared Decrease Decrease Decrease Increase Decrease Decrease\nwith 1984-5\n3.35 We have no doubt that the remarkable decrease in crime,\nwhich is revealed by these figures, was due to two principal causes: -\n(1) The programme of security improvements such as the\nstrengthening of doors and the installing of entry phones, which, in\nparticular, was responsible for the decrease in the number of\nburglaries.\n(2) The achievements of the Youth Association in providing\nactivities for unemployed young men and a sense of purpose in the\ncommunity generally. Stafford Scott described the effect of the Youth\nAssociation's work in terms which precisely echoed the sentiments of\nthe\nmuch\nmore conservative witnesses, who spoke about\nNeighbourhood Watch Schemes:\n\"We believe there was a rekindled community spirit. I used to\n49",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nтяс\nTHE POLICE AND THE COMMUNITY\nwatch a lot of programmes when I was younger about pre-war\nBritain, when people used to come out of their houses and leave\ntheir front doors open, and everybody knew everybody on the\nstreet. And although people weren't actually leaving their doors\nopen, there was a different kind of atmosphere.\"\nCliff Ford, an estate sweeper and member of the Tenants'\nAssociation Executive, as well as other witnesses, confirmed that the\nYouth Association was as concerned about crime as anybody else and\nwas trying to get it down.\n3.36 The police were annoyed that the Youth Association would not\nagree to a Neighbourhood Watch scheme being set up on the estate.\nYouth Association workers were concerned about such schemes in\nother areas. Their experience was that Neighbourhood Watch\nschemes targeted Black youths as objects of suspicion.\nIn any case, they thought that they were making progress in reducing\ncrime in the community in their own way, without the need for a\nformal scheme. On one occasion they had 'solved' a crime in a way\nwhich provoked considerable anger. Councillor Glenys Atkinson told\nDolly Kiffin that her handbag had been stolen on the estate.\nCouncillor Grant described what happened:-\n\"Dolly Kiffin had the youths going around trying to find her\nhandbag, and apparently they found the handbag within five or six\nhours, and they brought it back intact, with the purse and so on in\nit. And the police were angry. I remember there was a meeting\nafterwards, and the police kept referring to this incident. Why was\nit that the Youth Association could do something like that and they\ncouldn't?\"\n3.37 Chief Superintendent Couch and the Community Liaison\nOfficers had some understanding of the achievements of the\nBroadwater Farm community in reducing crime. But most of the rank\nand file officers, we believe, were infected by a venomous antagonism\ntowards the estate. The point was made politely in an aritcle in The\nPolice Magazine:-\n\"It has to be said that the very high opinion of Mrs Kiffin's sense of\nto civic responsibility and qualities of leadership, expressed by senior\nofficers, appears to find little concurrence among rank and file\nofficers dealing with the problems of the Youth Association's\nmembers on the estate.\"\n50\nOne can only wonder how this view was expressed within the confines\nof the police canteen or the Instant Response Unit van.\n3.38 It is necessary to stress the factor of racialism in the response of\nthe rank and file police. The report of the Policy Studies Institute,\nPolice and People in London, was based on a prolonged study carried\nout by experienced and reputable researchers. It was commissioned\nby the Metropolitan Police themselves. On the general level of\nracialist feeling within the police, they reported as follows:-\n\"Our first impression after being attached to groups of police\nofficers in areas having a substantial ethnic minority population was\nthat racialist language and racial prejudice were prominent and\npervasive and that many individual officers and also whole groups.\nwere preoccupied with ethnic differences... On the whole, our\nfurther research confirmed these initial impressions.\n3.39 For the police, the characteristic feature of the Broadwater\nFarm Estate was that the prominent community leaders were Black\npeople. Since no effective steps were being taken to educate junior\nofficers out of their racialist feelings, or into some genuine\nunderstanding of the community, the prejudice intensified with every\nincident. The evidence which we have heard about the treatment of\nBlack people is startlingly confirmed by the evidence of remarks\npassed to White people:- mod sales\n\"Oh you've had some coons breaking in, have you? I don't know\nwhy you live around here with bloody nig-nogs trying to break in to\nyour house.\" (Police officer to White woman after a burglary.)\n\"We've been burgled four times. On each occasion when the police\ncame to investigate, they have said automatically they had been\ndone by Blacks. They said: 'Oh it must be somebody off the\nFarm'.\"\n\"If we could have gone into the Youth Association we might have\nfound the person who did this.\"\n3.40 Over 1984-5, as Chief Superintendent Couch tried to exercise\nhis authority, a new element entered into the attitude of the rank and\nfile - one of discontent at their own superiors for not letting them\ndeal with the people on the Farm as they wanted to. One officer said\nto a nearby resident, who had been burgled:-\n\"It's a no-go area, we can't go onto there because we'll end up with a\nriot.\"\n51",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHE POLICE AND THE COMMUNITY\n3.41 It is necessary to look closely at the use of this term \"no-go\narea\". It seems to reflect a perception which is felt at the highest\nlevels of the Metropolitan Police. The Commissioner in his report for\n1983 spoke of Broadwater Farm as one of:-\n\"Those areas identified as 'symbolic locations' where Black\ncommunities, often the young, come to view a particular location\nwith something of a proprietorial attachment resenting intrusion,\nespecially by the police to enforce the law.\"\nHe was claiming, therefore, that it was Black people who did not\nwant the law enforced. Junior officers took up this theme, claiming\nthey were not being allowed by their superiors to police the area\nproperly.\n3.42 But when we look at the reality of the actions and words of the\nrepresentatives of the Broadwater Farm community, the idea of\n\"no-go areas\" or \"symbolic locations\" are seen to be a myth created by\nthe police as far as Broadwater Farm was concerned. The Youth\nAssociation never asked the police to keep out. As we have seen, they\nwanted more contact not less. During the 21st public hearing of the\nInquiry, Lord Gifford said: -\n\"We have not heard from anybody who is not pro law and order.\nWe have not heard from anyone who does not want the police to\ndo a job for the community.\nHis remarks drew applause from the largely Black audience in the\nhall. They reflected the evidence which we had heard. For in fact\nthere were regular police patrols through the estate in the 1980s, and\nvisits made frequently by senior officers, without molestation or\nopposition. The community did react in opposition to arbitrary\npolicing, oppressive policing, and racist policing. But they did not, as\nalleged by D.A.C Richards in his report, seek to resist normal and\nlawful policing methods.\nTHE POLICE AND THE COUNCIL\n3.43 Under the present law, the police authority for the London\narea is the Home Secretary. Local authorities have no legal role in the\npolicing of their borough. In practice, however, there needs to be\nco-operation in many areas, and officers and members of the\nHaringey Council met frequently with the police. Chief Executive\nRoy Limb described the pattern:-\n\"There was a sort of myth around that Haringey Council never\ntalked to the police. That's a load of nonsense, because going back\n52\ncertainly as long as I have been Chief Executive, there have always\nbeen meetings with senior police officers. What usually happened if\nan issue arises on an estate or something of that nature, I would\nsuggest, or be asked by a chair of committee or by the leader, to fix\nup a meeting with the local police chief, and I would.\"\nThere was, however, no structured basis for these meetings; they\ndepended on ad hoc co-operation on each side.\n3.44 Difficulties arose in Haringey because of the views held on both\nsides about police accountability. The council had resolved to support\nchanges in the law which would make the police accountable to a\nlocally elected authority. In 1983 they established a police sub-\ncommittee, comprising councillors and over 30 non-voting delegate\ngroups representing Black and minority ethnic groups, youth and\nwomen's groups, the elderly, lesbian and gay communities, and a\nnumber of other recognised organisations such as the Haringey\nCommunity Relations Council. Its terms of reference included the\nmonitoring of various aspects of policing, making recommendations\nupon matters relating to the police, and advocating democratic\naccountability of the police. Clearly it was hoped to achieve some\nform of accountability in practice, even though none was possible in\nlaw. From 1984 the sub-committee was serviced by a police research\nunit consisting of three officers.\n3.45 The police through Commander Dickinson were invited to\nparticipate in the work of the sub-committee, but Commander\nDickinson refused saying:-\n\"My constitutional position, as police commander responsible to\nthe Commissioner and the Home Secretary, debars me from\ninvolvement in the schemes outlined in the letter.\"\nThis was not correct. The law precluded the Commander from\nbeing answerable to the local authority, but it did not prevent co-\noperation and consultation with the council through any appropriate\nchannel. We understand that local senior officers in other areas\nco-operate with the council police committee and in at least one case\nattend meetings as observers. As we have said earlier, the attitude of\nCommander Dickinson in refusing to speak or write to the council's\npolice sub-committee was petty-minded and unhelpful for community\nrelations.\n3.46 The next attempt at a structured dialogue involving the council,\n53",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nтя\nTHE POLICE AND THE COMMUNITY\nthe police and the community concerned the Broadwater Farm Panel.\nThe council were anxious to include the police in what was developing\ninto a very useful forum for the discussion by different agencies of\nproblems concerning the estate. The process was that each agency on\nthe panel presented a brief report and answered questions from local\nresidents. The chair of the panel, Councillor Bernie Grant wrote to\nChief Superintendent Couch on 23rd January 1985, to confirm the\ninvitation.\n3.47 Chief Superintendent Couch replied on 5th February 1985:-\n\"I and my officers attend numerous meetings to respond to\ncommunity issues and demands, and never has a request been made\nfor a 'written report' in the council style. If we did, I and my staff\nwould be permanently preparing reports instead of combatting the\nincreasing crime rate, racial harassment and the problems of\nminority groups.\n\"In your position as ward councillor, I am always willing to inform\nyou of current trends and issues affecting local policing, but I am\nnot prepared to report in advance to the council-sponsored 'panel'\nwhich makes recommendations to the appropriate committee of the\ncouncil.\"\nThis reply does little credit to the reputation of Chief\nSuperintendent Couch as a community policeman, and rather bears\nthe imprint of Commander Dickinson. Councillor Grant agreed to\nhave further discussion at a meeting, and he wrote on 10th April\n1985:-\n\"I would therefore like to propose that we do meet together with a\nrepresentative from each of the Broadwater Farm Tenants' and\nYouth Associations. I would also be accompanied by Neale\nColeman, the Broadwater Farm Neighbourhood Officer, and an\nofficer from the police sub-committee research unit.\"\nChief Superintendent Couch replied on the 9th May 1985 expressing\n\"reservations\" about the number of people proposed:-\n\"If you feel that such numbers are required to meet police, then I\ndoubt if we are starting off on the right foot. I would like to know\nwhat you require of the police before I meet what appears to me to\nbe a vetting group.\"\n54\n3.48 The negative result of this exchange of correspondence was that\npolice officers never attended the Broadwater Farm Panel before the\n6th October disturbances. They never had the chance to discuss, in\nthe valuable open forum which the panel provided, any of the policing\nproblems which began to emerge during the summer of 1985.\nCouncillor Grant views this as a tragedy:-\n\"I would suggest to the Inquiry that if the police had come onto the\nBroadwater Farm Panel from as early as January 1985 when we had\ninvited them to, then I believe that we would have not had those\ndisturbances on 6th October on Broadwater Farm. Because if the\npolice had any problem with regard to the estate, they would have\nbeen able to put it down in front of the panel, we would have\ndiscussed it properly, it would have been reported on. The Youth\nAssociation was represented there, and the Tenants' Association,\nand the matter could have been resolved.\"\nWe certainly agree that another valuable opportunity had been lost\nbecause of the attitude of the police. We are glad to record that\nTottenham's new senior officer, Chief Superintendent Alan Stainsby\nattended the Broadwater Farm Panel meeting of 15th April 1986 and\nsubmitted a written report on crime figures and arrests on the estate.\n3.49 The next chapter in this history of failed opportunities between\nthe police and the council concerned the Haringey Community and\nPolice Consultative Group. The proposal made by Lord Scarman for a\nstatutory consultative scheme had been implemented by section 106 of\nthe Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which provided:-\n\"Arrangements shall be made in each police area for obtaining the\nviews of people in that area about matters concerning the policing\nof the area and for obtaining their co-operation with the police in\npreventing crime in the area.\"\nIn London, it was the duty of the Commissioner to make the\narrangements in accordance with guidance issued by the Home\nSecretary. The Commissioner was obliged to consult with the council\nof each London borough as to the arrangements that would be\nappropriate for the borough.\n3.50 On 27th February 1985 Commander Dickinson wrote to Mr\nLimb asking for a discussion about these arrangements \"with the\nleader and yourself\". On 2nd April 1985 Councillor Narendra\nMakanji, chair of the police sub-committee, replied to Commander\nDickinson. He observed that membership of the existing sub-\n55",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\ncommittee broadly coincided with the recommendations contained in\nthe Home Office guidance. He concluded:-\n\"We believe that the terms of reference of the council's police\nsub-committee provide an appropriate basis for this area's\nconsultation arrangements and accordingly invite the Metropolitan\nPolice Y District to enter into an arrangement for consultation on\nthe basis of these existing terms of reference.\"\n3.51 We think that in writing this letter the council was itself\nindulging in obstructive tactics. It must have been quite apparent to\nthem that Commander Dickinson could not possibly agree to enter\ninto consultative arrangements on the basis of the police sub-\ncommittee's terms of reference, when the Home Office guidance\nstressed the importance of such arrangements being independent of\nlocal authority structures. The reply from Commander Dickinson was\nswift and inevitable:-\n\"I am not able to discuss consultative arrangements on this basis\nfurther.\"\n3.52 Neither side had left any further room for movement. The next\ncommunication about the consultative group was from D.A.C\nRichards on 24th May 1985 when he invited the council to attend an\nexploratory meeting at which a good section of community\nrepesentatives would be present. The council considered that it had\nnot been properly consulted, and did not attend this meeting, or any\nother meetings of the Haringey Community and Police Consultative\nGroup which was subsequently formed. We will return later to\nconsider this state of affairs.\nTHE SUMMER OF 1985\n3.53 Morale on the Broadwater Farm was high. In the 3rd June\nedition, \"Broadwater Review\", the Youth Association magazine of\ncommunity news, led off with an article headed: \"Plan for new jobs.\"\nOther articles reflected the spirit of a community on the move:-\n\"SERVICES FOR TURKISH SPEAKING RESIDENCES.\"\n\"ASIAN ACTIVITIES AT THE MOTHERS' PROJECT.\"\n\"MINISTER TO VISIT.\"\n56\nbia\nTHE POLICE AND THE COMMUNITY\n\"DISABLED PEOPLE START TO ORGANISE.\"\n\"HAIRDRESSING SALON OPENED.\"\nThe fourth annual festival was announced for August, with \"the one\nand only Junior Delgardo\" and many other talents. The pool team.\nand the junior football team had done well in their leagues. The\nMothers' Project announced a crowded programme of events.\n3.54 In July the Youth Association organised a trip for its members.\nto Jamaica. The Youth Association had raised the funds for this trip\nthrough fund-raising events, and no council money was involved. Four\ncouncillors and Mr and Mrs Limb were invited on the trip by the\nYouth Association, at their own expense. Mr Limb explained the\npurposes of the trip:-\n\"One, it was to mark the enormous progress that the Youth\nAssociation had made. It was a sort of reward to itself for all the\nefforts that it had made over the last three or four years to arrive at\nthat stage. And secondly, and as a really marvellous example of the\nstage it had arrived at, it was going to Jamaica to help a Youth\nAssociation over there called West Park to raise its sights and to do\nsome actual work for it.\"\nThis was a valuable international exchange. The youths from\nBroadwater Farm built a fence arond the West Park club in\nClarendon, and repaired the access road. Even more, they learned\nabout Jamaica, where many of their parents had been born. There is\nto be a return visit by the West Park club in August 1986.\nThe main party returned at the end of August. Dolly Kiffin stayed\non in Jamaica until 23rd September.\n3.55 Before the Jamaica party left, a number of youths from outside\nthe estate had begun to congregate on Broadwater Farm. Norton\nMcLean, Principal Youth Officer for Haringey explained one of the\nreasons why, in his view, so many youths were attracted there:-\n\"One of the major points is that there were subsidised meals. And\nthere were large groups of unemployed young people that, if they\ncan go somewhere where you can get a good cheap West Indian\nmeal for about £1.60 which, in other places, you would pay £5 to £6\nfor, quite clearly that's an attraction.\"\nThe youths were not accepted inside the Youth Association\nbuilding, and they used to hang around the Tangmere precinct,\n57",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nkicking footballs, and sometimes riding motor bikes around the\nprecinct.\n3.56 While the party was away in Jamaica, a new set of strangers\narrived drug traffickers. They came in expensive cars and parked\nalong Willan Road. They had been pushed out of their former patches\nin Stoke Newington and Hackney after a police operation. They were\nselling drugs in little square packets. They were remarkably\nconspicuous in their activity:-\n\"It was horrible. You couldn't walk without someone\npropositioning you to buy drugs. Even if your mother walked under\nthere, they would ask your mother if she wanted to buy drugs. It\nwas not nice. They were out there day and night making a noise,\ndriving their cars up and down. It was really horrible.\" (Joanne\nGeorge, community worker).\n\"I was confronted with an individual walking up the steps with fists\nspread out with a joint sticking through each gap in the fingers.\"\n(Mike Bates, Youth and Community Service Officer).\n3.57 The officers of the Youth Association wanted the police to get\nthe pushers off the estate. Rupert Downing, the other Social Services\ncommunity worker on the estate, remembers one of the meetings with\nChief Inspector Stacey at the Youth Association in August 1985:-\n\"It was a completely unanimous policy that the police should be\nidentifying the vehicles that were being used, and that there was no\nreason once they had identified the vehicles for those vehicles not\nto be apprehended off the estate prior to them coming on and\ncausing us all the hassle.\"\nChief Inspector Stacey's view was that there was a vacuum in the\ncommunity because the leaders were away in Jamaica. Those present\nreplied: \"What leaders? we are all working together here.\"\n3.58 In September, when Roy Limb returned, he spoke to Chief\nSuperintendent Couch. He was told of the large numbers of strangers\non Broadwater Farm, and accusations of drugs being sold. There had\nbeen some incidents involving things thrown at policemen. There had\nbeen parties late at night at the Social Club. Mr Couch said that he\nwas in a dilemma whether to send in considerable numbers of police,\nor \"try and keep it calm and hope that normality would be restored in\ndue course.\" The conclusion reached by both men was:-\n\"That it would be better for us to avoid a major confrontation until\n58\nSECHIELS THE POLICE AND THE COMMUNITY\nthe leaders returned and hope that they could control things.\"\nBy the leaders, Roy Limb was referring to Dolly Kiffin and to\nClasford Sterling, who was also away. Chief Superintendent Couch\nmade the same point in an interview with \"World in Action\" in\nOctober 1986:-\n\"There were two ways I could deal with it. One was through the\ncommunity representatives. Regretfully both of them, as you may\nwell know, had gone on holiday and I had no-one to talk to.\"\n3.59 We believe that this was, with the best of intentions, a\nmisjudgement. it was not the case that there was \"no-one to talk to\".\nThere were other officers at the Youth Association in the absence of\nDolly Kiffin and Clasford Sterling. There were many people with\nwhom the drug trafficking problem could and should have been\ndiscussed, and action taken. If, as was the case, there was general\nagreement that the police ought to act, an operation could have been\nmounted which had the Youth Association's consent. As one of those\nworkers, Millard Scott told us: \"There is not going to be no riot for\ndrug pushers\".\n3.60 The inaction of the police leadership through August and\nSeptember had the further consequence of infuriating the team of\nhome beat officers. To them it was the final proof of the lunacy of\n\"community policing\". Cliff Ford, a sweeper on the estate, was\napproached by one of the beat officers: -\n\"He came up to me and said 'Are you a member of the Tenants'\nAssociation? Could you get your Tenants' Association to write a\nletter to our Superintendent, because we want to come in and sort\nthis estate out.\"\"\nWoman Sergeant Gillian Meynell in her report leaked to the press,\nrecords that on one occasion, at the request of Mr Couch, the home\nbeat team collected 50 of the empty drug packets and brought them\nback to the station:-\n\"Mr Couch said 'Oh how many have you got?' I said 50. He said\n'Oh just throw them out.' Why we bothered, I do not know.\nNeedless to say morale plummeted once again.\nThe Police magazine recorded later that constables were being\nstopped by members of the public and asked why police were unable\nto control the drug taking on the estate. It is a sad irony that the same\nquestion at the same time was being asked by the Youth Association\nof Superintendent Stacey. If the Youth Association and the home\n59",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nbeat officers had known each other, they would have found much to\nagree about.\n3.61 The pages of the Police Review for October 1985 suggest that in\naddition to the selling of drugs there were frequent attacks by people\non the estate against the patrolling home beat officers. In the light of\nthis we have examined very closely the Richards report. D.A.C\nRichards has listed a large number of incidents, some only supported\nby rumour, suggesting that violence was being prepared during the\nweeks prior to 6th October. There is one incident, and one incident.\nonly, of an attack upon the police. On 11th September, the day after\nthe Handsworth disturbances, two home beat officers were attacked\nwith missiles by a gang of Black youths, and one was struck on the\nhead and injured. We deplore this attack, but if there were others,\nD.A.C Richards would surely have recorded them in his report.\n3.62 On 23rd September Dolly Kiffin returned. She immediately\nnoticed a \"an enormous amount of cars, and strange faces that I have\nnever seen in my life\". Within hours she was meeting with\nSuperintendent Stacey. He told her about the drug traffickers. He\nsaid that they were coming from Brixton, Stoke Newington and\nFinsbury Park. Dolly Kiffin asked him what he was going to do about\nit. He replied that the police were waiting for her to call them in.\nDolly Kiffin described her reaction:-\n\"I jumped off my chair. I said you are waiting on me, Dolly Kiffin,\nto call you in and use the law? You get paid as the police and you\nwork as an officer, and you are waiting for me to call you in? That\nmeans you are putting my back against the wall, so that if there is\nanything, you can say that Dolly Kiffin called you in and publish\nthat. And then what happens? I get a knife in my back or shot in\nmy back, with these strange people? No, I am not going to call you\nin.\"\nNeale Coleman was also present at one of the discussions with\nDolly Kiffin during that week. He agreed that the police appeared to\nbe trying to put the responsibility onto the Youth Association:-\n\"And I think their feeling and Mrs Kiffin's feeling at the time was\nthat this was not her responsibility. Her view was clear that this was\nundesirable, and that action should be taken, but that it was not for\nher or for anyone else in the Youth Association to give authority\nfor this. It was felt that if there were undesirable or criminal\nelements involved, that was a matter for the police.\"\n60\nTHE POLICE AND THE COMMUNITY\n3.63 We think that there was another serious misjudgement here\nabout the nature of community policing. It should not be a question of\nabdicating responsibility for policing decisions to community leaders,\nparticularly in a matter so dangerous as drug trafficking. Rather, there\nshould have been close communication about the nature of the\noperation which the police would have had to mount, in order that\nresponsible people in the community could understand it and support\nit. This did not happen. It seems that there well may have been\nconflicting views between the Scotland Yard Drug Squad and the local\nforce as to the nature of the operation required. As to this, we are\nlacking evidence from the police which might enable us to understand\nwhat, if anything, was being planned against the drug traffickers. But\nthat does not excuse the mishandling of the situation which continued\nafter Dolly Kiffin's return.\n3.64 On Saturday 28th September Mrs. Cherry Groce was shot and\nseriously injured in Brixton, and there were disturbances in the\nstreets. It must have been appreciated by police in Tottenham that the\nshooting of a mother in her home by a police officer would cause\nfeelings of outrage in their community as well. Following on the\nHandsworth disturbances three weeks earlier it was a time for\nparticularly sensitive policing and close liaison with community\nrepresentatives.\n3.65 On Tuesday 1st October the police took action without any\nsuch consultation. Black people in cars were stopped and searched as\nthey went in and out of the estate. The relevance of this operation to\nthe drug trafficking problems is far from clear. Nick Wright of the\nPolice Research Unit, having had discussions both with local police\nand Scotland Yard officers, told us that this stop and search operation\nwas unconnected to any drugs surveillance, and that the police\nthemselves said that they were looking for stolen property. He\nbelieves that the drugs' officers were annoyed that a careful operation\nwhich they were mounting, which depended upon a degree of subtlety\nand discretion, was being disrupted by this crude stop-and-search.\nWhatever its purpose, the operation was called off after only a day,\nhaving achieved nothing except further resentment. As Mr Limb\nsaid:-\n\"The day of action was a disaster. The police ended up picking\npeople up who were just entering and leaving the estate. It was the\nold routine all over again. It had no effect except to wind up all of\n61",

            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHE DEATH OF MRS JARRETT\n4.3 We accept this verdict. It was the judgement of 12 citizens made\nat the end of a fairly conducted inquest, and we do not question it.\nNor have we attempted to conduct a re-run of the inquest evidence;\nthat would neither have been possible nor useful. Instead we have\nobtained the fullest possible notes of the inquest proceedings, and of\nthe later court proceedings in which Floyd Jarrett was acquitted of\nassault. In this chapter we summarise the evidence given to the\ninquest and to the court, adding our own comments where\nappropriate, and we comment on the statement made by the Police\nComplaints Authority (PCA) at the end of their investigation of the\ncircumstances surrounding Mrs Jarrett's death.\n4.4 In obtaining material about the inquest we have had generous\nhelp from members of the Jarrett family and their solicitor. They had\napplied to the Coroner for a transcript of the inquest proceedings,\nwhich they were ready to put at our disposal. Regrettably, such a\ntranscript has not been forthcoming from the Coroner's Court. It\nseems that shorthand notes were made by a shorthand writer whose\nfees were paid by the Metropolitan Police: transcripts cannot be made\navailable to the Coroner without the consent of the police which has\nnot been forthcoming. An official tape recording was also made, but\nno transcript from that could be completed in the time available to us.\nAccordingly we have relied on full notes which were taken both by\nDave Leadbetter, who was there as a representative of the Inquest\norganisation, and by Tracey Blom, a barrister. They represent a very\nfull though not verbatim record.\nTHE ARREST OF FLOYD JARRETT\n4.5 Floyd Jarrett has been an active member of the Broadwater\nFarm Youth Association for many years. He had been on the trip to\nJamaica. He lived in Enfield, having moved away from 25 Thorpe\nRoad about six months before. The events of 5th October 1985 begin\nwith the arrest of Floyd Jarrett, and the circumstances of that arrest\nare important. For the police, the suspicion which was said to attach\nto Floyd justified the decision to search his mother's home. For the\nfamily, the whole sequence of events beginning with the arrest of\nFloyd, was part of their complaint to the PCA.\n4.6 Just before 1.00 pm on Saturday 5th October, Floyd Jarrett was\ndriving with a friend along Roseberry Avenue, Tottenham, when he\nwas stopped by uniformed police officers. The reason given later for\n66\nthe stop was that one officer (PC Casey) had noticed that the car had\nan out-of-date tax disc, showing the expiry date 31st August 1985. PC\nCasey had radioed to officers in another police car (Sergeant Parsons\nand PC Allan) who had carried out the stop. PC Allan filled out a\nform which required the driver to report to a police station with his\ndriving and insurance certificate. The incident would normally have\nended there.\n4.7 PC Casey then decided to connect to the Police National\nComputer to make a check upon the car number and the name of the\ndriver. He was asked at the Magistrates Court why he had done this.\nStephen Solley, counsel for Floyd Jarrett, asked him: \"Would you\nhave checked me out if I had been driving with a tax disc five weeks\nout of date?\" The officer said no. Mr Solley asked if he could give any\nreason, other than that he was a Black man driving a flashy-looking\ncar (a BMW Coupe). He could give no reason.\n-\n-\n4.8 The computer check revealed that there was no trace of the car\nnumber UGX5OF, the number on the plates. But PC Casey observed\nWGX5OF and he\nthat the number on the tax disc was different\nput a check through the computer on this number. This did check\nout with a BMW car with the right chassis number - the record\nshowing that it had been sold a year before. Therefore it was not\nlisted as a stolen car. Floyd Jarrett was waiting by the car while these\nsteps were taken; he was not asked any questions about how he\nobtained the car. He explained that the number plates had always\nbeen like that, and it was apparent that they were very old and had\nnot been recently fitted. On the basis of this information, PC Casey\ndecided to arrest Floyd Jarrett for suspected theft of the motor\nvehicle.\n4.9 At this point Floyd Jarrett made a run across the road. He was\nchased by the three officers and soon caught. The officers claimed\nthat when they caught up with him, he struck two blows with his fist,\nthe second of which hit PC Casey in the face. However, an\nindependent witness, architect Ralph Harris, had witnessed the whole\nincident. He had seen the three officers run across the road and jump\nat Floyd Jarrett from behind. He had seen no punch to an officer's\nface, aimed or otherwise.\n4.10 Floyd Jarrett was charged with assaulting PC Casey. On 13th\n67",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHE DEATH OF MRS JARRETT\nDecember 1985 he appeared at the Magistrates Court and was\nacquitted of the charge. The magistrates made an award of £350 costs\nagainst the police, which indicated their belief that the charge should\nhave never been brought. In the course of the hearing the whole\nsequence of events leading to the arrest was closely examined. For\nexample, the police officers had alleged that the engine number inside\nthe car looked as if it might have been filed down, and that the chassis\nplate looked slightly curved. So the car was brought to court, and all\npresent were able to see that neither the engine number nor the\nchassis plate had been tampered with in any way. Mr Solley in his\nclosing speech to the magistrates said that this incident was a striking\ndemonstration of the importance of our civil liberties and that a\ncareless and prejudiced use of police powers had in this case set off a\nchain of events which had led to terrible consequences. The\nmagistrates by their verdict appear to have agreed. The charge itself\nwas a classic example of a \"knock-on\" charge such as we referred to\nearlier (3.5), where the arrested person is charged, not with anything\nrelating to the supposed reason for his arrest, but for an incident\nalleged in this case falsely - to have occurred as a result of the\ncontact with the police.\n-\n4.11 At 1.25 pm on 5th October Floyd Jarrett arrived at the police\nstation. He had given a false name and address. He said at the trial\nthat he had failed his driving test and ought not to have been driving\nwithout L plates. But within a few hours his true identity had been\ndiscovered. There was an invoice in the car in the name of Mr Jarrett,\nand the police were able to check that name against a photograph\nwhich was on file at St. Ann's Police Station and which proved that\nthe man in their custody was Floyd Jarrett, of 25 Thorpe Road, N.15.\nSergeant Parsons and PC Casey returned to Tottenham police station\nwith this information at 3.30 pm.\n4.12 At that point there were no grounds for holding Floyd Jarrett\nany longer and he should have been released. There was no evidence\nwhatever that the car was stolen; indeed the invoice showed that it\nhad been in Mr Jarrett's possession since at least May, and the\ncomputer information showed that its last registered owner had sold\nit. The officer even checked to discover whether any crimes were\nknown to have been committed by people using a blue BMW, but the\nanswer was negative. The sequence of events involving Floyd Jarrett\nand the police should have ended.\n68\nTHE DECISION TO SEARCH THE HOUSE.\n4.13 At this point Detective Constable Michael Randall intervened\nin the case. DC Randall is a C.I.D officer, then aged 24. He had been\nbased at Stoke Newington police station for some time, and had then\nmoved to Tottenham. He was an officer against whom two complaints\nhad been made in the summer of 1985, relating to his conduct of\nsearches in the homes of Black people. The barrister appearing for\nthe police at the inquest informed the Coroner that in one case there\nwere no formal disciplinary proceedings but DC Randall had received\n\"words of advice\". In the other case the complainant was awaiting\ntrial, so the complaint was still pending. The barrister said that he had\nreceived this information from Inspector Clarke, who was duty officer\nat Tottenham police station on 5th October.\n4.14 DC Randall was officially off duty but had come into the police\nstation at 4.15 pm to do paper work on a number of forthcoming\nCrown Court trials. According to his evidence, he heard about Floyd.\nJarrett being in custody, and went to his cell at 4.50 pm and Floyd\nJarrett recognised him. Floyd Jarrett told us that he had never met\nDC Randall at all. The offical custody record states not that Floyd\nJarrett recognised DC Randall, but the opposite. He then took the\ndecision that the Jarrett home should be searched. It was his decision,\nand it was approved by the duty officer, Inspector Clarke. He also\ndecided that he should go on the search himself.\n4.15 DC Randall claimed that \"from dealing with many of the\nyouths around the Tottenham area\" he knew that Floyd Jarrett \"was\nheavily involved in handling stolen goods\". He had heard \"other\nrumours from reliable sources\" that he was \"a major handler\". It is\nimpossible for us to know the exact nature and source of DC\nRandall's information; or to assess whether DC Randall had\nexaggerated the information which he had, in order to justify (after\nthe event) the decision to search. His attitude to house searches, and\nto the evidence needed to justify one, can be gathered from an answer\nwhich he gave:-\n\"I believe that PC Casey had sufficient grounds from the time.\nFloyd was arrested. He had given fake particulars. It looked as if\nthe car plates might have been fakes.\"\nWe do not agree that suspicion about a car should justify the\nserious step of invading the home. It would be a speculation, instead\nof concretely based suspicion that there were stolen goods to be found\nin the home.\n69",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHE DEATH OF MRS JARRETT\n4.16 There are other worrying features about the search. The pro\nforma warrant for a search for stolen goods contains a space for the\ndescription of the goods to be inserted. The instruction on the warrant\nsays: \"Specify stolen goods\". Yet on the warrant drawn up for 25\nThorpe Road, all that has been inserted are the words: \"Diverse\nGoods\". It would appear that the officers were very unsure about\nwhat they were looking for.\n4.17 Secondly, when the search did take place it was conducted in a\ncursory manner, as if all that was intended was a speculative visit.\nThere was one locked room in the house, which was in fact Patricia\nJarrett's bedroom. It was normally kept locked, because her brother\nborrowed her tapes. No attempt was made to enter it. Sergeant\nParsons said that he could see \"from the reflection in the brass light\nswitch\" that it was not a store room. The Coroner intervened:-\nCoroner: \"In my experience the best way to keep you out would be to\nhave a locked door!\"\nParsons: \"It depends on the search. This was intended, sir, to be a\nlow key search, a search of someone's home. We didn't knock things\ndown. We conducted a search of what we could see. We were satisfied\nthat it was not a room full of stock.\"\nCoroner: \"This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard!\"\n4.18 All the evidence points to this being a speculative search which\nshould never have taken place. If Floyd Jarrett was seriously\nsuspected of being a \"major handler\", then a proper investigation\nshould have been mounted on the basis of specific information if and\nwhen it was known. If, however, there were only vague rumours\nabout him, then the search was unjustified, and it did not become\njustified because he was in police custody.\nTHE WARRANT\n4.19 DC Randall said that the search warrant was typed by PC\nCasey at 4.50 pm and that PC Casey left around 5.00 pm to go to the\nhome of a magistrate. PC Casey said that he and PC Allan had left\naround 5.00; that the warrant was signed by the magistrate Mr\nGardiner at about 5.15 pm and that he returned to the police station\nabout 5.30 pm. The magistrate lived in St. Paul's Road, about five\nminutes drive from the police station.\n70\n4.20 Inspector Clarke gave evidence of a quite different time scale.\nHe said that he had authorised the search warrant at 3.45 pm; that PC\nCasey had shown him the typed warrant at 4.15 pm; and that PC\nCasey had left the police station to go to the magistrate at 4.50 pm\nand returned at 5.15 pm. He said that he had then seen the warrant\nand saw that it had been signed. He was challenged at the inquest\nabout an earlier statement which he had made to the Essex police in\nwhich he said that he \"agreed to issue the search warrant at 5.00 pm\".\nIn answer he said: \"In police work times are not very significant\".\nThis is a curious statement for a police inspector to make.\n4.21 Under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, which although\nnot in force was being given a \"trial run\" at Tottenham police station.\nat this time, there is a requirement for a custody record to be kept in\nrelation to everyone detained at a police station, in which all matters\nrelating to the case must be recorded. From 2.00 pm to 7.00 pm on\n5th October the officer responsible for keeping that record was\nSergeant Bowell. The first two lines of the second page of the custody\nrecord read as follows:-\n\"5.10.85. 5.15 pm. Search warrant obtained, declined to\naccompany police (signed) B132\".\nThe date is in Sergeant Bowell's handwriting, but the time and the\nrest of the entry are in the handwriting of Sergeant Parsons. Sergeant\nParsons had said in evidence that he had made the entry at 5.15 pm\nafter PC Casey had returned with the signed warrant.\n4.22 The Essex police, who had been investigating the circumstances\nof Mrs Jarrett's death under the supervision of the Police Complaints\nAuthority, went to the magistrate on 7th October and took a\nstatement from him. He said that he had signed the warrant for the\nsearch at 25 Thorpe Road between 6 pm and 6.30 pm. Assistant Chief\nConstable Simpson, who was in charge of the investigation, told his\nofficers to go back to the magistrate and re-interview him. In his\nsecond interview on 8th October, Mr Gardiner said that he thought\nthe time was between 5.30 pm and 6.15 pm. The magistrate gave\nevidence at the inquest, and said that he thought that he signed the\nwarrant at about 5.45 pm. We have no notes of his evidence, but we\nunderstand that in cross examination he was extremely vague. A\nstatement was also taken from the magistrate's mother, who said she\nput the arrival of the police at between 5 o'clock and 5.30 pm,\nbecause the cups of tea, which they usually take between 4.30 and 5\n71",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nтлочая\nTHE DEATH OF MRS JARRETT\npm were still on the table. She was not called to give evidence at the\ninquest.\n4.23 The search of 25 Thorpe Road began, according to the police,\nat 5.45 pm, although the family maintain that it was just before 5\no'clock, the officers left Thorpe Road at about 6.20 pm when the\nambulance had gone. Did the officers then rush in a panic to the\nmagistrate, knowing that they had no signed warrant and that the\nsearch had ended in tragedy? Or did they, as they claim, have a\nproperly signed warrant before they went to 25 Thorpe Road?\n4.24 The visit to the magistrate's house took two to three minutes\n(according to the officers) or about ten minutes (according to the\nmagistrate). The range of possible times, according to the evidence,\nis:-\nApprox. 5.00 pm\nApprox. 5.05 pm\nApprox. 5.05 pm\nApprox. 5.10 pm\nApprox. 5.15 pm\n5.30-6.15 pm\nApprox. 5.45 pm\n6.00-6.30 pm\nInspector Clarke (said that PC Casey had left\nthe station about 4.50 pm).\nSergeant Bowell (made entry at 5.15 pm).\nPC Allan (said they arrived at the magistrate's\nhouse at 5.00-5.15 pm).\nDC Randall (said PC Casey left at about 5.00\npm).\nPC Casey (evidence to the inquest).\nMr Gardiner's second statement to the Essex\npolice.\nMr Gardiner (evidence to the inquest).\nMr Gardiner (first statement made to the\nEssex police).\n4.25 There are a number of points which support the argument that\nno warrant was signed there until after the search was over:-\n(1) The time which the magistrate gave when first asked about this\nmatter two days after the event, as against the confused times by the\nofficers.\n(2) The entry in the custody record, which the Coroner had\ndescribed as \"peculiar\". Every other entry in the record was made by\nSergeant Bowell; this one alone was made by Sergeant Parsons.\nSergeant Bowell himself, who was on duty as the custody officer, said\nin evidence that he had never seen the signed warrant.\n72\n(3) The fact that the usual practice of telephoning the magistrate\nbefore going around to his house was not followed. This was even\nmore strange because Mr Gardiner was not normally called on to\nissue warrants out of court hours. The magistrate normally used had\nsuffered a bereavement. PC Allan told the inquest that the name and\naddress of Mr Gardiner were only given to himself and PC Casey by\nradio while they were in the car; and DC Randall said that it was he\nwho had suggested the magistrate's name. All this suggests a hasty\noperation rather than one which had been properly arranged from the\npolice station.\n(4) PC Casey alone went into the magistrate's house. PC Allan, who\nwas a probationary officer 14 weeks out of training school, stayed in\nthe car. It would have been normal for PC Allan to accompany PC\nCasey in order to learn the procedure. But not, perhaps, if the search\nhad already taken place, and the magistrate was being deceived.\n(5) After returning to the police station DC Randall made an entry\nin the \"premises searched record\". He filled up everything except for\none line the name of the magistrate who granted the warrant. This\nwas left blank. At the inquest it was put to him that this was because\nno warrant had by then been obtained. His reply was:-\n\"No. I did have the warrant in front of me. I cannot remember why\nI missed it out. I was going down the page filling the form in.\n-\nIt seems to us extraordinary that DC Randall, who had himself\nsuggested the magistrate's name, did not fill it in unless there was\nstill some uncertainty as to whether he had in fact signed the warrant.\n(6) Finally, as we shall see, Patricia Jarrett stated clearly that no\nwarrant was shown to her by any of the officers who came to her\nhouse.\n4.26 On the other hand, the police would argue that there was no\nreason for them not to obtain a search warrant before carrying out the\nsearch, and that people are frequently vague and inaccurate about\ntimes. While we are unable to make a definite finding on this issue,\nthere was at least a strong case against the officers that they carried\nout the search without a signed warrant. We return later to consider\nhow the Police Complaints Authority dealt with this aspect of the\ncase.\n73",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHE DEATH OF MRS JARRETT\nTHE SEARCH\n4.27 The police officers involved thought that the search might not\nbe straightforward. Inspector Clarke said to PC Casey at a briefing\nmeeting held before the officers left, that he hoped that \"the search\nwould not start any riots\". A district support unit and an area car\nwere provided to stand by in case there should be any trouble. The\ncontroller at the police station, PC Fletcher, said to the inquest that\nhe had been asked by DC Randall to keep his radio open because he\nwas going to search \"a coloured family\", and if there was any trouble\nhe would want urgent back-up. In the circumstances, and given the\nrumours of trouble which the police were well aware of, it is strange\nthat there was no liaison with more senior officers, or with the\ncommunity liaison officer, about this search. The Chief Executive Roy\nLimb was angered by this failure to recognise the sensitive\nimplications of Floyd Jarrett's arrest:-\n\"Floyd Jarrett was arrested about 1.00 pm on a Saturday. DC\nRandall knew that he was a founder member of the Broadwater\nFarm Youth Association. Everybody knows Floyd Jarrett. Yet he\nwas held in custody for about four hours, and neither Couch nor\nany of the senior officers appeared to know anything about this.\nHere was a vital thing that happened and it didn't get to the senior\npoliceman, so the matter could be handled in a sensitive way. That\nis one of the really worse features for me of the events.\"\nWhen asked about this, Inspector Clarke said that \"he did not\nconsult Superintendant Stacey because of the distance from where we\nhad expected trouble\". DC Randall said that he \"he didn't think\ncommunity liaison came into it\".\n4.28 The four officers - DC Randall, Sergeant Parsons, PC Casey,\nand PC Allan - arrived at 25 Thorpe Road at around 5.45 pm.\nSergeant Parsons was the senior officer in rank, but it is clear that DC\nRandall effectively took charge of the operation. He said to the others\nas they approached the door: \"I'll do the talking\". It is a quiet street.\nAcross the road Mr Adams was sitting on his roof doing repairs. He\nsaw the arrival of the police, and was curious. He saw them stop on\nthe path as if discussing their tactics.\n4.29 The officers had taken Floyd Jarrett's keys along with them.\nThey had not booked the keys out with the custody officer Sergeant\nBowell, who confirmed that this should have been done. They used\nthe keys to enter 25 Thorpe Road. There seems little doubt that they\n74\ndid not knock at the door. Mr Adams did not hear any knock and nor\ndid Patricia Jarrett inside the house. The officers claim that they\nknocked three times, but none of them remembered the distinctive\nhorseshoe knocker on the door. DC Randall, who said that he did the\nknocking, said that the knocker was a lever on the letter-box.\n4.30 Inside the house were Mrs Jarrett, Patricia Jarrett, with a\ngrandchild of two and a neighbour's baby. Patricia Jarrett heard her\nmother say \"Lord, Lord, there's some police in the house\". When\nasked how they got in, Sergeant Parsons said that the front door had\nbeen left open. Mrs Jarrett and Patricia Jarrett knew that to be\nuntrue; they would never leave the door open with young children in\nthe house. Sergeant Parsons admitted to the inquest that he had told\nthis untruth, \"in order not to aggravate the situation\". In our view the\nwhole account of this entry into a private house the use of the keys,\nthe failure to knock, the lie about the open door reveals a casual\nindifference on the part of the officers and constituted a shocking\nviolation of the privacy of the Jarrett's home.\n4.31 The house is on two floors. On the ground floor at the front\nwas Mrs Jarrett's bedroom: half way back, a room which used to be\nFloyd's room; and at the back a dining room, with a kitchen attached.\nOn the first floor at the front was a lounge; towards the back a locked\nroom which was Patricia Jarrett's room; and at the back Michael\nJarrett's room. On this floor there was also a bathroom. The officers\nafter entering started to move through the various rooms. Patricia\nJarrett told the inquest that she asked if they had a warrant, and was\nshown nothing. But DC Randall and PC Casey claimed that she had\nat one point taken the warrant and read every word out aloud - even\nthe words \"to each and all the constables of the Metropolitan Police\nForce\" at the top of the warrant. The new law requires that a copy of\nthe warrant be left with the householder, but even though the new law\nwas having a trial run, this was not done. The officers said that they\ndid not know about this requirement.\n4.32 Patricia Jarrett said in evidence that the officers searched\nFloyd's old room. Then they searched Mrs Jarrett's room; Mrs Jarrett\nasked why they were searching it, as she only had her personal\npossessions there. (At one stage the officers tried to deny that her\nroom was searched until PC Allan admitted that he had searched\nit). They searched the lounge upstairs, and the laundry in the\n-\n75",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nbathroom. They searched Michael's bedroom, but made no effort to\nget into her locked room. She then described what happened when\nDC Randall moved towards the dining room: -\n\"He went into the dining room. My mother had put Jerome into\nthe armchair and was standing in the doorway. He took his left\narm, pushed her out of the way. She fell with one arm in the\narmchair and the rest of her body towards the armchair going\ntowards the kitchen. I tried to help her up. When I had managed to\nget her to her feet DC Randall had come back into the dining room\nand passed over and went to the sideboard. I helped my mother to\nthe chair. She was gasping for breath and gasping quite heavily.\nShe asked me to phone for the emergency doctor as she was not\nfeeling well. I took the telephone book and called the emergency\nanswering service. I spoke to a woman who said that there was not\na doctor available so I should dial 999 immediately and explain the\nsymptoms of my mother. I did this and they told me there would be\nan ambulance.\"\nThe electronically timed record at the exchange showed that\nPatricia Jarrett's 999 call was made at 5.55 pm. It took two minutes\nfor her to be connected, and the ambulance service received her call\nat 5.57 pm.\n4.33 Patricia Jarrett described the push again in detail:-\n\"I saw Randall take his left arm and put it around my mother's\nshoulder and part of his body pushed her and she fell with her left\narm out, breaking the small table.\"\nPatricia's account continued as follows: Mrs Jarrett was sitting at\nthe dining room table. After Patricia telephoned the ambulance, her\nmother asked for her tablets on top of the fridge in the kitchen. DC\nRandall was still in the dining room. He had been looking in the\ndrawers of the sideboard, and while Patricia was telephoning for an\nambulance he was looking at the hi-fi and the television. Patricia gave\ntablets and some water to her mother, who asked for some\nunderclothes to be packed. She went into the garden to collect some\nclothes from the line. When she came back she noticed that her\nmother's breathing had become laboured. She asked her: \"What's the\nmatter mum?\" She then heard a voice in the passage which she\nrecognised as her brother Michael's. Michael asked the officers why\nthey were there, and asked his mother if she felt all right. He asked\none of the officers if he had a warrant and received no reply. DC.\n76\nTHE DEATH OF MRS JARRETT\nRandall then left the dining room and went upstairs. He had not\nshown any concern, but simply continued with the search. Michael\nfollowed him upstairs, where they were looking into the loft of the\nhouse.\n4.34 Patricia's evidence continues:-\n\"The officer left the dining room and went upstairs. My mother\nwas breathing hard. She tumbled sidewards out of the dining room\nchair, lying on her side. I rushed over and started talking to her. I\nthen saw a uniformed officer and my brother Michael standing at\nthe bottom of the stairs. Michael said Floyd does not live here, and\nhe wanted them to leave the house. I then showed the officer out.\nWe made it quite clear to them that Floyd did not live there, we felt\nit was in our rights to ask them to leave. They did so. Michael and I\nrushed back into the dining room. I knelt down at my mother's\nside. Michael rushed out of the house. I put my ear to her mouth to\nsee if I could feel any breath. I felt for her pulse but did not feel\nany pulse. I blocked her nose, opened her mouth and gave mouth\nto mouth resuscitation. Nothing was happening. She looked up at\nme, her eyes keeled over, her head slumped back and she was\nDecompletely still. I ran from the house screaming into the street.\"\n4.35\nMichael Jarrett had left the house in order to see if a nurse who\nlived at number 12 was at home. She was not, but Michael used the\nphone there to ring for an ambulance. His 999 call was electronically\ntimed at 6.00 pm. He was connected to the ambulance service at 6.01\npm. As they waited for the ambulance to arrive the police remained\noutside. Inspector Clarke arrived, having been alerted by a message\nfrom DC Randall. DC Randall said that he had first-aid experience,\nand that the family should let him come in and help. Michael Jarrett\npersuaded Patricia to let DC Randall in. For a time he tried mouth to\nmouth resuscitation, and an airway device was brought in from one of\nthe police cars. But when a mirror was put to Mrs Jarrett's mouth,\nthere was no mist on the glass. At 6.11 pm the ambulance arrived,\nand Mrs Jarrett was lifted into it. The ambulance left at 6.20 pm and\nreached North Middlesex Hospital at 6.35 pm where it was certified\nthat Mrs Jarrett was dead on arrival.\n4.36 At the inquest, the four officers gave an account which\nconflicted with that of Patricia in major respects. The main thrust of\ntheir evidence was that Patricia Jarrett had been abusive almost from\n77",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nthe start, shouting and swearing obscenities at the officers; that\nMichael Jarrett had joined in the abuse after he arrived; and that\nthere had been no contact of any kind, accidental or deliberate,\nbetween DC Randall and Mrs Jarrett. The case put by the barrister\nrepresenting the four police officers at the inquest was that Mrs\nJarrett suffered stress:-\n\"Not by misbehaviour on the part of the police, but by the\nanti-police attitude of the children.\"\n4.37 At the inquest this central allegation effectively fell to the\nground. It was contradicted by evidence from Inspector Clarke that he\nreceived a message at 5.55 pm from DC Randall, made after he had\nsearched Floyd Jarrett's former room, that \"we are in the house and\nthe search is under way. There are no problems\". As a result of this\nmessage, Inspector Clarke radioed the area car and told it to go away.\nIt was contradicted by Mr Adams, who heard no sounds of any\nshouting from inside the house. It was contradicted by the evidence of\nthe electronicially timed calls showing that Patricia Jarrett was on the\nphone seeking assistance for about two minutes. DC Randall claims\nnot to have seen this. He said only that Patricia tapped out a number,\nslammed the telephone down and went on swearing. It was\ncontradicted by further evidence from Mr Adams, who heard DC\nRandall making another radio call after being told to leave the house.\nHe heard DC Randall say these words:-\n\"The search was quiet but I must warn you .... the lady of the\nhouse has collapsed.\"\n4.38 At one point, while PC Allan was giving evidence, the Coroner\nmade a telling intervention. PC Allan had said that he had not seen\nPatricia Jarrett pick up the phone or make a call, but she was just\nshouting and swearing. Counsel representing the Jarrett family then\ntold the officer of the evidence of the electrically timed calls, and the\nCoroner said:-\n\"It is quite obvious that their statements are contrary to the facts.\nMembers of the Jury, the purpose of learned Counsel's questions,\nwhich he is fully entitled to ask, is to go to the credit of the police\nofficers. It may not bear directly on the death but I am allowing it\nbecause it is important for you to be able to assess the truthfulness\nof the witness.\"\n78\nTHE MEDICAL EVIDENCE\nTHE DEATH OF MRS JARRETT\n4.39 Mrs Jarrett, who was 48 years old, was suffering from a very\nsevere heart disease. She had had treatment for high blood pressure,\nbut her family had no idea of her heart condition. Evidence about the\ncause of her death was given to the inquest by a leading heart\nspecialist, Dr Somerville. He said that as a result of the disease, death\nmight have been triggered off by physical activity or an emotional\nupset. There would be a sudden increase in the heart rate,\naccompanied by an alteration of the rhythm of the heartbeat. This\nwould reduce the effectiveness of the heart and could lead to the lungs\nbecoming water-logged. The strain, whether physical or emotional,\nwould release adrenalin, and this would cause the acceleration of the\nheart rate. Once that train of events had been precipitated, it would\nbe impossible to halt.\n4.40 Dr Somerville was questioned at length as to the severity of the\nemotional or physical upset which would be needed to set these fatal\nevents in motion. It was pointed out that Mrs Jarrett had led a normal\nand active life, and had survived a number of family difficulties\nincluding troubles that some of her children had had with the police.\nDr Somerville agreed that if the police officers had simply gone into\none room and then left, it was unlikely that death would have been\ncaused. He said that the sudden arrival of the police in her hallway\nwould be likely to cause pumping of adrenalin. But a push by the\npolice followed by a fall would have been \"an important precipitating\nfactor\" on top of the emotional stress aroused by the arrival of the\npolice. The Coroner summed up the medical evidence to the jury in\nthis way:-\n\"If there were this continuous emotional stress, Dr Somerville has\nreminded us that a fall or push would make an important\ncontribution to continuing stress. It would, indeed, be an important\ncontributory factor in the chain of events. This is because the\nhumiliation and indignity consequent on a push or fall would be an\nadded precipitating factor in a heart already under strain from\nemotion.\n\"Mrs Jarrett could have died at home, or while she was out. Dr\nSomerville said that she was a candidate for death at any time.\nObviously we must accept that, but, ladies and gentlemen of the\njury, she didn't die at any time, she died then.\"\n79",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHE DEATH OF MRS JARRETT\nTHE VERDICT OF THE JURY\n4.41 In an inquest, the parties who are represented have no\nopportunity to address the jury about the verdict which they would\nwish the jury to return. The only guidance they get is from the\nCoroner. The Coroner in this case, Dr David Paul, told the jury that\nfour verdicts were open to them:-\n(1) Unlawful killing. To bring in such a verdict, the jury would have\nto be sure that the police officers were either intentionally or\nrecklessly threatening harm or causing harm which caused Mrs\nJarrett's death: or that they were deliberately doing something (in this\ncase pushing) that all reasonable people would realise would subject a\nperson to a risk of being harmed, and which did in fact cause death.\nThe Coroner told the jury that if they were satisfied that Mrs Jarrett\nwas pushed so that she fell, they would be entitled on the basis of Dr\nSomerville's evidence to find that the fall caused the death.\n(2) If the jury was satisfied that there was a push, but were not sure\nthat the push was a deliberate act, but was merely a consequence of\nsomeone going through a narrow place and brushing Mrs Jarrett\naside, the proper verdict would be accidental death.\n(3) If the jury were sure that there was no fall, but that the fatal\nchain of events was started solely by the emotional stress surrounding\nthe search, then the proper verdict would be that death occurred from\nnatural causes.\n(4) Finally, if the jury were not sure that they could return one of\nthese three verdicts, then they would be entitled to return an open\nverdict.\n4.42 The jury returned an unanimous verdict of accidental death.\nThe Jarrett family said in a statement through their solicitor:-\n\"The verdict of the jury is a vindication of our complaint against\nthe police officers who arrived at our house on 5th October. Our\nmother died as a result of a push by a detective during a careless\nand callous search by four police officers who during the inquest\nhad been forced to admit to lying, to numerous breaches of their\ncode of conduct and to total inconsistency between the ambulance\nrecords and their fabricated story. We expect that apart from any\nother action, the officers concerned will be severely disciplined.\"\n80\n4.43 This was a case which demonstrated the value of inquest\nproceedings in throwing light on the circumstances of a tragic and\ncontroversial death. The Jarrett family were well represented by\nbarristers and by a solicitor who, since legal aid is not available for\ninquest proceedings, gave their services without a fee. The evidence\nof all the witnesses the family, the police, and other witnesses -\nwas fully tested in cross-examination. The Coroner, according to\nmany who were present, conducted the proceedings fairly and\nimpartially. The jury were given a range of verdicts which fitted the\nvarious possible theories of the cause of death. The evidence had\nraised a number of serious questions about the propriety of police\nactions on 5th October. The verdict not only underlined these\nquestions, but showed also that the jury believed that DC Randall at\nleast had been lying in a central aspect of his evidence. We must now\ncompare the investigation made at the inquest with the investigation\nmade into the same matters under the supervision of the Police\nComplaints Authority.\nTHE POLICE COMPLAINTS AUTHORITY\n4.44 The Police Complaints Authority began to function in January\n1985. It was a new body set up by the Police and Criminal Evidence\nAct 1984. Its letterhead proclaims that it is \"the Independent Police\nComplaints Authority -the public's impartial representative in the\ninvestigation of complaints against the police\". Under the law it does\nnot investigate complaints itself; it supervises the investigation of\ncomplaints, the investigation itself being carried out by police officers.\nNormally the P.C.A becomes involved because of a complaint; but\nthere is an exceptional procedure whereby a chief officer of police\nmay refer a matter to the P.C.A because of its gravity, even though\nthere has not been a complaint, if the matter appears to indicate that\na police officer may have committed a criminal offence or an offence\nagainst discipline. This was the power which was invoked on the\nevening of 5th October 1985. It is significant that the Commissioner,\nin invoking this power, must have considered that the officers.\ninvolved may have committed a criminal offence or an offence against\ndiscipline, but did not even so suspend those officers from duty. We\nreturn to this question of suspension in the next chapter.\n4.45 The investigation was carried out by Assistant Chief Constable\nSimpson of the Essex police. In correspondence with Bernard Carnell,\nsolicitor for the Jarrett family, he sought to clarify the extent of the\n81",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTROPEL\nTHE DEATH OF MRS JARRETT\ncomplaints which they wished to raise. Mr Carnell made it clear that\nthe family were complaining not only about events inside the home -\nthe push of DC Randall against Mrs Jarrett, the insensitive behaviour\nof the four officers, and their failure to produce a warrant - but also\nabout the whole basis upon which the decision to carry out the search\nwas made, the means by which the officers gained access to the house,\nand the entire sequence of events that caused the officers to stop and\ndetain Floyd Jarrett in the first place.\n4.46 The \"independent\" status of this investigation came under\nsevere attack during the inquest itself. Patricia Jarrett and other\nmembers of the Jarrett family had provided signed statements to the\nEssex police in confidence for the purpose of the investigation. But\nduring the course of Patricia Jarrett's evidence at the inquest, the\nbarrister representing the four officers began to suggest that\nsomething said by her in her evidence was at variance in her statement\nto the Essex police. It became apparent that this barrister had\nreceived copies of these confidential statements. The barristers acting\nfor the Jarrett family protested at this breach of confidence and\nsecured, as a matter of fairness, that the statement made by the four\nofficers should be disclosed to them. It transpired that A.C.C.\nSimpson of the Essex police had passed the statements to the\nCommissioner, without consulting the P.C.A. and without imposing\nany limitations upon their use by the Commissioner. The P.C.A.\nissued a press statement stating that they were disturbed to learn that\nthe statement had been used by the Metropolitan Police without their\nconsent.\n4.47 The reason given for the handing over of the statements was\nthat the Commissioner as the disciplinary authority, was entitled to\nsee them. That is no doubt the case at the end of an investigation, but\nthis investigation was still in progress. We are most concerned, both\nthat the statements were given to the Commissioner at that stage, and\nthat the Commissioner saw fit to supply them to the solicitor who\nrepresented those very officers whose conduct was being investigated.\n4.48 When an investigation has been completed, the investigating\nofficer submits a report to the P.C.A. The P.C.A. must make a\nstatement as to whether the investigation was not conducted to their\nsatisfaction, and the case is then considered by the chief officer of\npolice for the area, who decides whether or not to refer the case to\n82\nthe Director of Public Prosecutions for criminal charges, or whether\nto refer disciplinary charges. The P.C.A. also has the duty to consider\nthe question of criminal or disciplinary charges, and they have the\npower to direct that the case be referred to the Director of Public\nProsecutions, and to recommend to the Chief Officer of Police (or if\nhe is unwilling, direct him), to prefer specified disciplinary charges.\nThey are precluded from publishing any information which they have\nreceived except in the form of a summary statement.\n4.49 On 14th April 1986, four months after the end of the inquest,\nthe P.C.A. published a news release and attached to it their summary\nstatement about the investigation into the death of Mrs Jarrett. But\nthe news release stated that no criminal charges had been preferred by\nthe Director of Public Prosecutions, and no disciplinary charges were\nrecommended by the Metropolitan Police. It stated that the P.C.A.\nagreed with that recommendation. They said that the investigation\nconducted by Assistant Chief Constable Simpson had been\ncomprehensive and \"a model of speed and thoroughness\", The\nsummary statement of the P.C.A. is for the most part a recital of the\ndifferent versions of the offence given by the witnesses at the inquest.\nBut there are two passages where the P.C.A. appear to give their own\ninterpretation of the material which was before them. The first\npassage concerns their comment on the inquest verdict: -\n\"The jury tended to accept neither party's version completely but\nimplied, in accordance with directions given by the Coroner, that\nDC Randall did not push Mrs Jarrett but in all probability\ninadvertently brushed past her causing her to lose her balance.\"\n4.50 This was a serious misreading of the jury's verdict. It is\nincorrect to say that the jury \"tended to accept neither party's version\ncompletely\". On the essential issue of whether DC Randall pushed\nMrs Jarrett, they accepted Patricia Jarrett's evidence and rejected that\nof DC Randall, who totally denied that he had any kind of physical\ncontact with Mrs Jarrett. On the further question, was the push\ndeliberate or unintentional, the jury decided that they could not be\nsure that it was intentional. This was not a rejection of Patricia\nJarrett's evidence. Patricia Jarrett could only tell the jury what she\nsaw DC Randall do; whether what he did was deliberate was a matter\nfor the jury. Further, the words \"inadvertently brushed past\" made\nmuch too light of the action for which, on the jury's verdict, DC\nRandall was responsible. An officer carrying out a search has a duty\n83",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nto treat members of the household being searched with care. A\npushing or brushing aside of a large woman standing in a doorway\neven if it was not intentional, was an act of carelessness and grave\ndiscourtesy, and as such, in our view, a serious departure from the\nstandards which the public are entitled to expect from police officers.\n4.51 Secondly, the P.C.A. reviewed the evidence relating to the\nsearch warrant and the time of the visit to the magistrate, and\nconcluded:-\n\"The police officers claim they were in Thorpe Road from 17.45\nuntil just after 18.20, when the ambulance left and this is\ncorroborated by evidence given by an ambulance officer. It would\nhave been very difficult for the police officers to leave Thorpe\nRoad at 18.20, return to Tottenham Police Station, type out the\nwarrant and then go to Mr Gardiner's house by 18.30 and get the\nwarrant signed, remembering that 18.30 is the latest time by which\nMr Gardiner is prepared to admit signing the warrant.\"\nWe are to assume that on the basis of this reasoning the P.C.A. are\nsatisfied that a warrant was duly obtained. We do not find it\nconvincing. In the first place, the officers may well have typed up a\nwarrant before leaving the police station, but had decided for some\nreason to get it signed later on. Secondly, there was time after 6.20\npm for the officers to rush at speed to the magistrate's house. Thirdly,\nand perhaps most important, this reasoning does not confront the\nbasic problem that the magistrate, when first asked about the time on\n7th October, estimated it to be between 6 and 6.30 pm, - a full hour\nafter the police officers claimed to have visited him.\n4.52 We are bound to say that the P.C.A., in agreeing that there\nshould be no disciplinary charges preferred against any of the officers,\nhave failed lamentably to grapple with the real issues raised by the\nevents of the 5th October. Let us recall what the evidence of the\ninquest and the Magistrates Court hearing revealed:-\n(1) That the officers who first stopped Floyd Jarrett made computer\nchecks on his car, apparently for no other reason than he was a young\nBlack man.\n(2) That they arrested him and took him into custody on a suspicion\nthat his car was stolen which had little if any reasonable basis.\n(3) That they made a charge against him of assault which was found\nto be false.\n(4) That they embarked upon a search of his family's home which\n84\nТяочая уя\nУАШТ THE DEATH OF MRS JARRETT\nappears on the evidence to have been entirely speculative.\n(5) That a number of features in the evidence indicated strongly that\nthe search was carried out without having obtained a warrant signed\nby a magistrate.\n(6) That the officers took Floyd Jarrett's keys out of his property\nwithout the authorisation of the custody officer.\n(7) That they used those keys to enter 25 Thorpe Road without\nhaving alerted the occupants by knocking on the door.\n(8) That one of the officers lied to the occupants of the house in\nsaying he found the door open.\n(9) That distress was caused to Mrs Jarrett both by the sudden\nintrusion of the officers and by a quite unnecessary search of her\nbedroom.\n(10) That one of the officers conducted himself so carelessly as to\npush past Mrs Jarrett as she stood in the doorway and cause her to\nfall.\n(11) That this push and fall, coupled perhaps with other upsetting\nfeatures of the search caused her death before it would naturally have\noccurred.\n(12) That after Mrs Jarrett fell and was clearly unwell the officer\npresent expressed no concern but merely continued his search.\n(13) That after the event the officers told lies about the behaviour of\nthe Jarrett family and covered up their own misconduct.\n4.53 The offences for which police officers may be disciplined are\ncontained in the Discipline Code, which is part of the Police\n(Discipline) Regulations 1985. It includes the following offences:-\nA\nAbuse of authority, \"which offence is committed where a member\nof a police force treats any person with whom he may be brought\ninto contact in the execution of his duty in an oppressive manner\nand, without prejudice to the foregoing, in particular where he:-\n(a) without good and sufficient cause conducts a search, or\nrequires a person to submit to any test or procedure, or\nmakes an arrest; or\n(b) uses any unnecessary violence towards any prisoner or any\nother person with whom he may be brought into contact in\nthe execution of his duty, or improperly threatens any such\nperson with violence; or\n(c) is abusive or uncivil to any member of the public.\"\nDiscreditable conduct, \"which offence is committed where a\nmember of a police force acts in a disorderly manner or any manner\n85",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHE DEATH OF MRS JARRETT\nprejudicial to discipline or reasonably likely to bring discredit on\nthe reputation of the force or of the police service.\"\nRacially discriminating behaviour, \"which offence is committed\n(without prejudice to the commission of any other offence) where a\nmember of a police force:-\n(a) while on duty, on the grounds of another person's colour,\nbrace, nationality or ethnic or national origins, acts towards\nthat other person in any such way as is mentioned in abuse of\nauthority (above); or\n(b) in any other way, on any of those grounds, treats improperly\na person with whom he may be brought into contact while on\nduty.\"\nNeglect of duty, \"which offence is committed where a member\nof a police force, without good and sufficient cause:-\n(a) neglects or omits to attend to or carry out with due\npromptitude and diligence anything which it is his duty as a\nnilmember of a police force to attend to or carry out, or\n(b) fails properly to account for, or to make a prompt and true\nstatic return of, any money or property received by him in the\ncourse of his duty.\"\nFalsehood or prevarication, \"which offence is committed where a\nmember of a police force knowingly or through neglect makes any\nfalse, misleading or inaccurate oral or written statement or entry in\nany record or document made, kept or required for police\npurposes.'\nBeing an accessory to a disciplinary offence, \"which offence is\ncommitted where a member of a police force incites, connives at or\nis knowingly an accessory to any offence against discipline.\"\n4.54 In our opinion the P.C.A. failed to act as an independent or\nimpartial authority in two major respects. First, it disregarded the\nverdict of the jury. There had been two conflicting cases argued at the\ninquest on behalf of the family and the police officers. The jury had\nfound against the officers on the central question of the push, and by\nimplication cast severe doubt on all the other claims of the officers\nwhich were in dispute. By recommending no action, the P.C.A.\nappeared to put itself above the jury. Secondly, the P.C.A.\nspecifically failed to exercise its powers to recommend, and if\nnecessary direct, that disciplinary charges be preferred. The 13\nmatters raised above, if proved, would constitute one or more of the\noffences in the Disciplinary Code. Given these failures in one of the\n86\nP.C.A.'s first major investigations, it is not surprising if confidence in\nthe new machinery is low.\nTHE EVENING OF 5TH OCTOBER\n4.55 At 7 o'clock, Floyd Jarrett was released. He told us that an\nofficer told him, on the way out of the police station, that his mother\nhad had a stroke. He did not even know that there had been a search\nof his mother's home. He went to the hospital and then later on to\nBroadwater Farm. Martha Osamor was telephoned, and she went\nwith Floyd and Dolly Kiffin to 25 Thorpe Road. Many community\nleaders called at the home during the evening in an immediate\nreaction of sympathy and respect.\n4.56 Chief Superintendent Stainsby, who was acting as chief officer\nat Tottenham Police Station as Chief Superintendent Couch was away\non that day, called at 25 Thorpe Road and expressed sympathy to the\nfamily. He told them that an independent investigation would be\ncarried out by an officer from another force. Martha Osamor\ndescribed the meeting: -\n\"The family were still very, very angry and a lot of questions were\nasked. Some of the questions were: How did they get into the\nhouse? He said he doesn't know. Did they have a warrant? He said\nhe doesn't know. Where are they are now, are they still working?\nHe doesn't know. He is going to find out.\"\nIt was also confirmed at the inquest that Patricia Jarrett on that\nevening was saying to Chief Superintendent Stainsby that her mother\nhad been pushed by DC Randall.\n4.57 It is all the more surprising that on the evening of 5th October\nthe following statement was issued by the Metropolitan Police:-\n\"Mrs Jarrett was initially very co-operative. But, towards the end\nof the search, another of her sons arrived home and began strongly\nobjecting to the presence of the police. She collapsed and the\nofficers were physically shoved out of the house. Eventually they\npersuaded the occupants to let them back in, and one of the officers\ntrained in first aid, administered mouth to mouth resuscitation\nwithout success.\"\nThis account is clearly designed to put the officers in the best possible\nlight and the Jarrett family in the worst. Far from maintaining a\nneutral position while investigations continued, the higher authorities\nof the Metropolitan Police took a partisan position from the outset.\n87",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nThey appeared to pre-empt and influence the \"independent\"\ninvestigation before it had even begun. The statement led directly to a\nreport in the Mail on Sunday on the 6th October which appeared to\nput the police story beyond doubt:-\n\"Scotland Yard confirmed that 49-year-old Mrs Cynthia Jarrett\nbecame ill after she was in a struggle with officers who visited her\nhome following the arrest of her son.\"\nWe consider that it was quite wrong for an official statement to be put\nout which stated the police view alone of an event which was known\nto be disputed and which was under investigation by another force.\n4.58 Late that night after midnight, members of the Jarrett family\nand a number of friends went down to Tottenham Police Station to\ndemand more information. They again saw Chief Superintendent\nStainsby. After a lot of pressure he went away and produced a copy of\nthe warrant. Mr Jarrett could see at once that it was not a warrant\nwhich could have been taken on the search, because it was a clean,\nuncreased piece of paper. But the original warrant was not produced,\nand they could obtain no more answers. Martha Osamor said of the\nvisit:-\n\"For them to behave in such an insensitive way, for him to keep\nrepeating to us what he has already said, meant that a lot of people\nwho were there felt they were treating us as if we hadn't got any\nsense at all.\"\n4.59 While they were inside the police station they heard the sound\nof smashing glass. People in a small demonstration outside had\nthrown some stones at the police station windows. The Jarrett family\nand the community leaders present were able to persuade them to\nstop and go home. George Martin, of the West Indian Leadership\nCouncil, was one of those there. Before he left he said these words to\nthe Chief Superintendent:-\n\"This is no longer a family matter. It's gone beyond that. It has\nnow become a community matter, and I think that it is important\nthat somebody of some importance makes a statement.\"\n88\n88\nChapter 5\nWHAT HAPPENED?\nOCTOBER 6\n-\nReactions to the Tragedy\n5.1 The news of Mrs Jarrett's death spread quickly. Some learned\nabout it during the night at a party, some the next morning.

Stafford\nScott spoke for the feeling of many:-\n\"Because it has happened before - police officers have taken away\npeople's keys and entered their homes without alerting the people\ninside it was easy for people to believe it had happened in this\ninstance. Because people have seen police manhandling members\nof their families whilst raiding, it was easy to believe in this\ninstance. So what was actually taking place was a lot of emotional\ntransferral.

            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nOCTOBER 6- WHAT HAPPENED?\nMillard Scott put it quite simply:-\n\"There is no way we can accept the death of a Black mother within\nour community.\"\n5.2 During the morning there was a lot of telephoning between\ncommunity leaders and the police. Roy Limb had heard the news\nfrom Dolly Kiffin at about eight o'clock:-\n\"I thought about it that Sunday morning and then rang Couch and\nsaid 'There is enormous tension within the community now. We\nmust explain to people properly what happened. You've got to tell\nus what happened', in my own mind hoping and praying that there\nwas a rational explanation for what had taken place.\"\nAt the same time the senior youth officer Mike Bates was\ninstructing Stafford Scott and other youth workers to go down and\nhelp keep things calm.\n5.3 The police arranged a meeting which started at 12.45 pm at\nTottenham Police Station. D.A.C. Richards was in the chair, with\nChief Superintendent Couch and another senior officer. There were\ntwo councillors, Ernie Large and Andreas Mikkides; Roy Limb, the\nChief Executive; Eric Clarke, chair of the Community and Police\nConsultative Group; Chris Kavallares, chair of the Haringey\nCommunity Relations Council (HCRC); Jeff Crawford, senior\nCommunity Relations Officer of the HCRC; Hyacinth Moody, chair\nof the HCRC Police Liaison Committee; Dolly Kiffin; and Floyd and\nMichael Jarrett, who came after Dolly Kiffin insisted that she would\nnot attend the meeting unless members of the Jarrett family were\nthere.\n5.4 In the words of Ernie Large, D.A.C. Richards was \"totally in\ncharge\" at the meeting. In answer to all questions, all he would say\nwas that there was going to be an inquiry under the supervision of the\nPolice Complaints Authority; that the Chief Constable of Essex would\nlook into the matters raised; and that he could not comment further.\nBecause of his experience as a magistrate, Ernie Large concentrated\non the question of the warrant, but got no answers:-\n\"Down came the curtain that it was subject to an inquiry, there was\nnothing they could say, therefore it was all a one-way traffic. Which\nJoannoyed me. If you want to defuse a situation, you have to defuse\nit by being open\".\n90\n5.5 There were demands from all the people from the community\nfor the suspension of the officers who had been involved in the search\nof Mrs Jarrett's home. Roy Limb was very clear about the reaction of\nD.A.C. Richards: -\n\"Richards' answer to that was that the matter was now out of his\nhands. They had already put it in the hands of the Police\nComplaints Authority. I was rather surprised by that and said so.\nBut that was what they insisted upon, that the matter was in the\nhands of the Police Complaints Authority and therefore they\ncouldn't say anything about it.\"\nThis was an incorrect answer. The suspension of police officers\npending inquiries is a matter of internal discipline for the senior police\nofficer to decide. Later on in a letter to Roy Limb, the deputy chair of\nthe Police Complaints Authority, Roland Moyle, confirmed:-\n\"The question of suspending police officers is outside the powers of\nthe Police Complaints Authority. Suspension is a matter for the\nMetropolitan Police.\"\nThe Police (Discipline) Regulations lay down the legal position:\n\"Where a report, allegation or complaint is received from which it\nappears that a member of a police force may have committed a\ndisciplinary or criminal offence, the chief officer concerned may\nsuspend that member from membership of the force and from his\noffice as constable, whether or not the matter had been\ninvestigated.\"\n5.6 We find it extraordinary that an officer of D.A.C. Richards' high\nrank was not able to give correct information about a matter which\nwas of intense concern to those present. Many witnesses have stressed.\nto us that the suspension of the four officers was the one action which\nthe police could have taken which would have given some assurance\nto the Black community that the circumstances of Mrs Jarrett's death\nwere being taken seriously. We agree. Suspension from duty is a\ncommon practice in many walks of life when something serious has\nhappened and there are disputed allegations to be investigated.\nSuspension would have implied neither guilt or innocence. The death\nof a woman during a police search of her home was just such a case.\nThe failure to suspend was short sighted and insensitive. The\ncommunity leaders left the police station at 1.50 pm in a sombre\nmood. Roy Limb said: -\n\"All I can say is I was extremely sad when I left there and very\n91",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nOCTOBER 6- WHAT HAPPENED?\nconcerned, because we had heard nothing that could help us to go\nand defuse the tension that was there in the community.\"\n5.7 As they left, a demonstration was gathering outside the police\nstation. It grew to over a hundred people and lasted for about one and\nhalf hours. There was angry shouting at the police officers who were\npresent. Some people lay in the road. One stone was thrown through\nthe police station window but otherwise there was no violence. The\npolice response was restrained and sensible. They blocked off the\nHigh Road in both directions to give room for the demonstration.\nThey policed the demonstration with a thin line of officers in ordinary\nuniform, with special units well out of sight. They stood while the\ncrowd shouted angrily and made intimidating gestures, without\nreacting or making arrests. Chief Superintendent Couch described the\nscene to a meeting of the Community and Police Consultative Group\nwhich we attended:-\n\"I and nine officers stood for one and a half hours taking all that\nthey could give us. We wanted to let them vent their feelings.\"\nNick Wright of the Police Research Unit paid tribute to both the\nChief Superintendent and his officers:-\n\"Couch is perhaps the most sophisticated politician amongst the\npolice locally. He understood the necessity of dealing with it in\nthose terms. He wasn't the only one. His subordinates right down\nto the local PCs understood that they had to deal with it on the\nstreets there. It wasn't just him but his officers were in amongst the\ncrowd, unarmed, not equipped with riot gear, talking to people.\nThey didn't arrest anybody, they didn't get angry, they just stood\ntheir ground and argued the point and it gradually went down. I\ndon't think that could happen without effective leadership.\"\n5.8 A meeting of Black community leaders had been arranged for\nthe afternoon at the West Indian Centre in Clarendon Road. People\nat the demonstration protested about this. They said they did not\nknow the West Indian Centre and did not believe that it would be an\nadequate place to hold a meeting. They believed that there should be\na meeting on the Broadwater Farm Estate. They thought - rightly as\nit turned out that many people would come to the Youth\nAssociation because of Floyd Jarrett's close involvement with it. They\nwanted those who were prominent in the Black community to come\ndown and tell them exactly what the position was and assure them\nthat there would be no cover-up of how Mrs Jarrett had died. So the\n92\ncommunity representatives who had been at the police station were\nasked to come on from the West Indian Centre to the Youth\nAssociation at any time after 4 pm for a second meeting. At around\n3.30 pm, as the demonstration was getting a bit ragged and the Youth\nAssociation workers feared that there might be violence, they took\naction to avoid it. They advised people to leave the police station and\ncome back for the meeting on the estate.\n5.9 The meeting at the West Indian Centre started about two\no'clock. There was an audience of about 40 people. On the platform\nwere Martha Osamor, chair of the Haringey Independent Policing\nCommittee; William Trant, an officer of the West Indian Standing\nConference; Councillor Bernie Grant, and Councillor Steve Banerji,\nchair of the police sub-committee. Councillor Banerji noticed that\nthere was \"a significant absence of Black youth at the meeting\"; but\nthe older people in the audience gave accounts of their own\nexperiences at the hands of the police. Nick Wright wrote in his report\nthat \"the most striking thing was the deep anger of the audience\".\nThere were calls for the suspension of the police officers, and a\nresolution was passed containing four demands:-\n(1) A full public inquiry into Cynthia Jarrett's death;\n(2) The resignation of D.A.C. Richards;\n(3) The withholding of the Metropolitan Police precept by the\ncouncil;\n(4) For the Jarrett family's account of their mother's death to be\naccepted.\nDolly Kiffin came in during the meeting to report on the\ndemonstration and the feelings of the people there. She then went on\nto the Youth Association. Other people followed to the Youth.\nAssociation after the meeting at the West Indian Centre ended. They\nwere George Martin, Vernon Moore and Arthur Lawrence, all\nmembers of the West Indian Leadership Council; Martha Osamor,\nRoy Limb, Councillor Grant and Councillor Sharon Lawrence. They\nreached the Youth Association at various times between 5.30 and 6.00\npm.\n5.10 People had been gathering at the Youth Association during the\nafternoon. Eventually there were about 70 people there of all ages,\nincluding a number of older parents. Stafford Scott described to us the\nbewilderment and confusion he observed during the period before\ncouncillors and others came from the other meeting:-\n93",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nOCTOBER 6- WHAT HAPPENED?\n-\n\"There were no plans. People were terribly upset this was\nsomething totally new to the community. We as professional\ncommunity and youth workers weren't sure how to handle the\nsituation, much less the ordinary members of our Youth\nAssociation or ordinary members of the community. People were\nbewildered there was no clear decision on what to do next.\nPeople wanted to see the big shots of the community, and they\nwanted to hear exactly what was being said so that they could come\nto some kind of decision. But because of the nature of what\nhappened, emotions were running high, people were feeling bad,\nbut they were feeling sad at the same time. There were no clear cut\ndecisions being taken either way. A lot of people wanted to return\nto the police station to protest, a lot of people thought it would be a\nwaste of time, a lot of people thought it would lead to trouble.\"\n5.11 There were two community reactions taking place during the\nafternoon which though separate were not in conflict. The established\nrepresentatives of the Black community, mainly from the older\ngeneration, were meeting in an ordered way to express their grief and\nanger through a formal resolution. Others, mainly but not entirely\nyoung people, were gathering at the Youth Association and were\nwanting to express that grief and anger through an immediate and\nactive protest. Martha Osamor described the interaction between the\nolder and younger people:-\n\"By this time, remember it's almost 24 hours now, there\nhasn't been any kind of answer to any of the questions. No move\non the part of the police to calm things down or help us to calm\nthings down. So we got to the meeting and the youths were still\nvery angry. So what they said to me was that we've come to the\nstage now where I have to go. They said they are not going to stop\nme from meetings, from passing resolutions and so on, but at the\nsame time they don't want me to stop them from going back to\npicket the police station, because they want the answers\".\n5.12 Dolly Kiffin had gone upstairs to her office and did not take\npart in the meeting. The Youth Association workers tried to get a\nformal meeting structure going, with Martha Osamor in the chair, but\nas she told us, she could not play a chair's role:-\n\"It's difficult to say who chaired it. What I wanted to do was for me\nto speak to them, then introduce Bernie from the council to say\nthat the council has agreed things like this Inquiry, and other things\n94\nthat we were demanding for them to do. But they didn't even let\nme finish or let Bernie start.\"\nCouncillor Grant spoke of the intensity of the anger in the room: –\n\"The fact that they didn't allow me to speak seemed to indicate to\nme that if I had spoken it wouldn't have made any difference at all.\nPeople were really hyped up. I have never seen anything like it.\nPeople were very, very threatening. They were very aggressive.'\nMrs Scott, the mother of Millard, Stafford and Roger Scott,\nrecalled what happened in vivid language:-\n\"And Bernie was mentioning marching to Downing Street and the\nHouse of Commons, but the voice of the children went over\nBernie, and he couldn't talk. And because Bernie wasn't able to\ntalk there, I shouted at them and asked them to listen to what\nBernie had to say. But they think Bernie was more White minded.\nThat was the opinion of most of them, that Bernie wasn't going to\ngive them the right.\"\n5.13 Mrs Scott spoke strongly for the proposal to go back to the\npolice station:-\n\"And I said to them, 'let's go back to the police station today, and\nwhatever they are going to do let them do it out there'. I said,\n'when we get there we'll sit in the road and we'll stop every car that\ncomes down. So let them take us up off the road and do what they\nlike, because the next one can be me'.\"\nGeorge Martin was also content with the police station decision.\nWe asked whether in view of the anger it would have been a peaceful\ndemonstration. He replied that there were enough older people that\nwere respected by the youths to make sure of that. \"I don't think they\nwould have created any problems while we were there.\"\n5.14 The decision to go again to the police station reflected the\nestablished custom in the Black community, which had been\nexpressed on many occasions in the past, that when they believe that\nthe police have been responsible for an outrage, it is to the police\nstation that people must go to express their feelings and to demand\ninformation. Stafford Scott described the reasons:-\n\"We knew that by going to the police station we wouldn't achieve\nanything. The police would not suddenly say OK, we did wrong,\nyou can all go home. But we wanted the police to see that this\ncommunity was going to stand together, that this community would\nnot accept the death of one of its older members, a law abiding\n95",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nOCTOBER 6- WHAT HAPPENED?\nolder member at that. And yes, we would like to stop traffic, we\nwould like to cause enough inconvenience that television cameras\nare down there, so what we are feeling is actually being made\nknown to the public.\"\n5.15 Around 6.30 to 6.45 pm the meeting broke up and people\nbegan slowly to move towards the police station. There was not to be\na march. Groups were just going to make their way there. If they had\nreached the police station, there would have needed to be a further\nexample of sensitivity on the part of the police for a confrontation to\nhave been avoided. It would have been the duty of the police to have\ndone everything possible to have enabled that demonstration to have\npassed off without disorder. But in the event those who resolved to go\nback to the police station got no further than the edge of the estate.\nTHE DEPLOYMENT OF THE POLICE\n5.16 We described earlier how the Tottenham police were saying\nwell before 5th October that a riot was likely in their area. Their\nprecautions intensified after the shooting of Mrs Groce at the Brixton\ndisturbances. We have read the reports of Mr Kennedy, the Fire\nOfficer in charge of operations for North London. In a report written\nafter the Brixton disturbances, he said:-\n\"It should be known that every day since 28th September, the\nbrigade had been advised by the police that civil disturbances had\nbeen expected in both North and South London areas, with\nBrixton, Balham, Lewisham, Tottenham, Harlesden and Hackney\nas possible sources where trouble on a large scale could be\nexpected.\"\nIn his report on the Broadwater Farm events Mr Kennedy said: -\n\"Due to closer liaison with the police in all divisions since the\nBrixton civil disturbance the previous weekend, the duty officer in\nthe J Division had been informed on 5th October 1985 by the police\nthat trouble was expected that weekend in the areas of Tottenham\nHigh Street and Wood Green.\"\nHe set up a \"forward control point\" on 5th October at the New\nRiver Sports Ground in White Hart Lane in order to be accessible to\nboth areas.\n5.17 It is clear from these reports that the police were generally\nexpecting riots in areas with large Black populations in the week\nfollowing Brixton, and were specifically targeting the Tottenham/\n96\nWood Green area for the weekend of 5th/6th October, before the\ndeath of Mrs Jarrett. Dolly Kiffin recalls going shopping on the\nmorning of 5th October in Wood Green and Bruce Grove and seeing\n\"a whole heap of police cars and vans\".\n5.18 Since the police were expecting riots in the Tottenham area\nthey would also have had the Broadwater Farm Estate in the forefront\nof their minds. It was revealed in the Police Review that there had for\nmany months been in existence a document entitled \"Contingency\nPlans for the Control of Disorder on the Broadwater Farm Estate -\nTottenham\". A visitor to Tottenham police station had observed that\nin four or five parts of the police station there were pinned up maps of\nBroadwater Farm, which stood out as the only maps apart from the\nmap of the district.\n5.19 So there was already a keen state of readiness on 5th October.\nBy the morning of 6th October, the police leadership would have\nbeen well aware of the reaction of the community to the death of Mrs\nJarrett. According to the Richards report, the reserve manpower for\nthe area was increased for Sunday to 200 officers in each of two eight\nhour shifts, made up of some coach serials and some district support\nunits in transits. One of their bases was a feeding centre in\nNorthumberland Park, half a mile north of the estate. In the early\nafternoon they would have heard of the demonstration at Tottenham\nPolice Station. We have already given credit for the policing of that\ndemonstration, and the fact that the reserve units were not called out\nto confront it. But as the Richards report states:-\n\"Police officers who were present had differing conceptions of the\nintention of the demonstrators. Some thought that the threats that\nhad been made were more rhetoric arising from a release of anger\nand tension; others were quite convinced that there would be\nattacks on police and/or serious disorders later in the day.\"\nAs the day shift (10.00 am - 6.00 pm) waited through the day, the\natmosphere must have been charged with anticipation of trouble.\n5.20 At 3.15 pm on 6th October two of the Broadwater Farm home\nbeat officers were visiting an address in The Avenue when bottles and\nmissiles were thrown at them. The Richards report says that a crowd\nof Black youths were responsible. A witness whom we interviewed\nsaw the two officers retreating \"under the attack of two coloured\nyouths, who threw bottles and missiles at the police\". One officer, PC\n97",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nCaton, was struck in the back and suffered a severe injury to his\nspleen. Information about the attack must have been passed back to\nthe waiting officers. They must also have been aware that the people\nwho had been at the demonstration outside the police station had\ngone into the Broadwater Farm Estate for the groups leaving the\npolice station would surely have been observed and followed. Indeed\nthe police received calls between 3.15 and 4.15, according to the\nRichards report, that up to a 100 youths, some of them wearing\nmasks, were running through the estate banging on doors. We have\nhad no direct evidence about this. But whether true or not, it confirms\nthat the attention of the police was centred on Broadwater Farm.\n5.21 Then for two hours, while the meeting was going on in the\nYouth Association, nothing happened. According to the Richards\nreport this was also the period of change over of the police shifts at\nthe Northumberland Park \"feeding centre\". The report says:- 1912\n\"It was necessary, in order to provide all day coverage to have a\n10.00 am to 6.00 pm shift and a 4.00 pm to midnight shift, each of\n200 men, the two hour overlap being required for briefing, feeding\nand changeover purposes.\"\n5.22 Because the police have not participated in the Inquiry, we do\nnot know what was said at the briefing of the new shifts. We do know\nfrom the Richards report that at around 6.30 pm there was an order\nthat only protected district support unit vehicles should answer calls to\nthe Broadwater Farm Estate. The report states that this was ordered\nbecause of the attack on PC Caton, and because of a second attack at\n6.30 in The Avenue, when two Black youths on a motor cycle had\nsmashed a bottle into the driver's window of a police car. We do not\nknow what other instructions were given to the large force of police\nthat was assembled to deal with the situation that had developed\nthrough the day. It was obvious by the end of the afternoon that\nBlack youths had gathered on the estate in large numbers and that the\nsituation was still very tense. Some plans must have been made to\ndeal with possible disorder on the estate.\nTHE OUTBREAK\n5.23 After about 6.45 pm some people left quite promptly from the\nYouth Association after the meeting. Mrs Scott wanted to take her\nyoung daughter home and go on from there to the police station. She\nwalked up Willan Road and onto The Avenue, where she saw two big\n98\nOCTOBER 6-WHAT HAPPENED?\ntransit vans coming up \"full with officers in uniform with riot gear\".\nThey passed the head of Willan Road and continued down The\nAvenue. Then she saw a third van. She looked back and saw the third\nvan turn down Willan Road:-\n\"So I thought: 'Oh my God, they gone down there and those\nchildren are there'. But I still didn't think there was going to be\nanything.\"\nShe went on her way to Bruce Grove. Martha Osamor was very\ntired and drove home to have a rest. She too saw the three transit\nvans driving down The Avenue. At the time that she left the youths\nfrom the meeting had not begun to come up Willan Road.\n5.24 A woman who lives at the junction of Willan Road and The\nAvenue left home at about two minutes to seven to go to the shop on\nthe corner of The Avenue and Mount Pleasant Road. As she came\nback, she saw two minibuses with metal grills come past and turn into\nthe estate. About three cars which were coming out of the estate\nmade U-turns and followed the police vans back in. Soon afterwards\nshe heard a sound as if bottles were being smashed.\n5.25 The view from inside the estate was given to us by Arthur\nLawrence and George Martin, who with Vernon Moore, were\nrepresentatives of the West Indian Leadership Council. They were\nbeing driven by Vernon Moore out along Willan Road from\nTangmere. They were just reaching the bend in Willan Road when\nthe first clash occurred. About ten youths, the first group to come\nfrom the meeting, were walking up towards the Willan Road exit.\nArthur Lawrence recalls seeing one police transit van which had\nreached a point in the road by the day nursery. The youths went up\nand knocked on the van with their hands. They had no weapons. The\nvan reversed back and the youths ran after it. At that moment two\nother police transit vans approached from The Avenue.\n5.26 George Martin also described the first contact between the\ngroup of youths and the lead van:-\n\"They rushed out in front of the vans, attempted to stop them\ncoming any further and shouted out that they are coming.\nObviously the other youths that were behind us heard and chased\nup to pass us, to make sure that it didn't proceed any further. They\nbanged the van to make sure that the van didn't come down there.\"\nHe too saw no weapons used. He said that the three vans came\n99",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\ndown one after the other in line, but we think, looking at the evidence\nboth from those outside and those inside, that one van came down\nfirst and two others followed shortly afterwards.\n5.27 Joanne George saw the scene when the vans had reversed back\nand reached the junction of Willan Road with The Avenue. She was\nbeing driven back in a mini-cab from the Bruce Grove area. As she\nreached Willan Road, two of the police vans were reversing out. A\ngroup of about ten youths ran down from the direction of Stapleford\nand threw some bottles at them. She had her young children with her,\nand ordered the driver to go straight on and away from the estate.\n5.28 A woman living in Rochford, with a good view over Willan\nRoad, saw three or four youths going up the hill. Then a police van\ncame half way down the hill. She believed that it reversed into the\ndriveway near the day nursery and turned around to go up the hill\nagain. Then other police vans came down. Soon the whole area was\nswarming with police and youths.\n5.29 Stafford Scott had stayed behind to help lock up the Youth\nAssociation, and caught up the main group as it moved up the hill\ntowards the exit. He could see vans at the junction, and one or two\nmissiles thrown. He went with a large group towards Mount Pleasant\nRoad. The officers were getting out of their vans at the junction of\nMount Pleasant Road and The Avenue. By the time he reached the\njunction, officers in riot uniform were already out of their vans,\nhitting people with truncheons and telling them to get back into the\nestate. He was pushed back. He spoke of the fury in the voices of the\npolice:-\n\"There was cries of 'wait until we get in there and get you, you\ncoons, you don't come out until we tell you, get back in there, you\nbastards, get back in there'. So the whole group got pushed back\ninto the estate. The only people who may not have been pushed.\nback were a few of the older ones. Most of the people ran down -\nthis was a very frightening moment, people had just seen police\nofficers jumping out of vans and attacking them with truncheons,\npeople pushed back into the estate with no apparent reason. A lot\nof people said 'no, don't go back, why should we go back?' So a lot\nof people wanted to resist the police pushing us down the hill. A lot\nof people were not interested in resisting, they decided to run back\ndown the hill. It was a general state of confusion. There were\n100\nOCTOBER 6- WHAT HAPPENED?\nyoung girls there with young children and then a lot of screaming, a\nlot of shouting.\"\n5.30 At a little before 7.00 pm Cliff Ford heard a shout and looked\nout of his window on the 12th floor of Northolt block. He saw a group\nof lads running up Willan Road and off the estate. Within a few\nminutes \"the group seem to be running back\", and he saw the Willan\nRoad exit \"sealed off by the police\".\n5.31 Arthur Lawrence and George Martin saw the three vans return\nto the junction and move down towards Mount Pleasant Road. Mr\nMoore then drove his car across the junction and stopped a short way\nacross in Marsden Road. George Martin and Arthur Lawrence got\nout while Vernon Moore went to park his car further away. By the\ntime they had returned to the junction, The Avenue was completely\nblocked by police in riot gear, out of their vans, at the Mount Pleasant\nRoad junction. The youths were on the corner of Willan Road and\nThe Avenue. Some of the youths then began to turn over cars, and\nmissiles were thrown at the line of police. Two cars were turned over\nand burned close to the junction. They attempted to turn over\nanother car but were stopped by George Martin and his colleagues.\nSoon after a wall at the corner of Willan Road and The Avenue was\nknocked down and dismantled for ammunition to throw at the police\nline. The fighting had started.\nNick Wright of the Police Research Unit had been, with his colleague\nDebbie Wild, observing the movement of police vehicles in Tottenham\nHigh Road. From about 6.00 pm to 6.30 pm he had seen a build-up of\npolice traffic in both directions both district support unit vans and big\ngreen buses. At a certain point towards 7.00 pm it became clear that\nsomething serious was going on, because police vehicles were coming\nfrom both directions and turning into Bruce Grove toward Lordship\nLane. They were clearly in a hurry:-\n\"There was one incident where two big green police coaches were\ndetained at the red traffic lights at the junction of Tottenham High\nRoad and Bruce Grove. They were so anxious to go up Bruce\nGrove and Lordship Lane that they jumped out of their vehicle and\nbanged on the roof of a car that was waiting at a red traffic light,\nand told the car to move so that they can jump the lights.\"\nThe time of this observation would correspond with the time of first\ncontact between the group of youths and the police van on Willan\nRoad.\n101",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nOCTOBER 6- WHAT HAPPENED?\n5.32 The Richards report states that at 6.40 pm there were two\ndistrict support units of local officers in the vicinity of the estate. 999\ncalls were made at 6.49 pm and 6.53 pm, saying that police were\nneeded in The Avenue. The report continues:-\n\"A D.S.U. (Y 32) went to the scene to investigate but shortly after\ntheir arrival, at 7.05 pm, they were subjected to a violent attack by\na large group of Black youths, who threw bricks and petrol bombs\nat their vehicle and struck at the bodywork with machetes. The\nferocity of this attack was such, that had the officers not been in a\nprotected vehicle, they would almost certainly have been killed or\nseriously injured.\"\nThe report adds that Y 32 then withdrew to a safe location in order\nto put on protective equipment, and the Wood Green control room\nbegan to mobilise the men who were immediately available. The\nreport continues with a paragraph which we will have to examine with\ngreat care:-\nf\n\"Units began to arrive at the scene from 7.10 pm onwards. They\nfound that a barricade of blazing vehicles had been erected at all\nfour vehicular entrances to the estate, (Gloucester Road, Willan\nRoad, Griffin Road and Adams Road) and at each location they\ncame under missile and petrol bomb fire as they approached.'\n5.33 This report conflicts with the evidence which we have received\nin a number of very important respects:-\n(1) The evidence is that the first van came into the estate and down\nWillan Road as far as the day nursery. The Richards report does not\nstate this, saying only that the van was called to The Avenue, and\nwent to \"the scene\".\n(2) The report mentions only one district support unit van. But the\nevidence is that three vans were on the scene in the initial stages and\ncame down Willan Road into the estate. They would contain a total of\nover 30 officers.\n(3) The evidence before us is that the initial contact between the lead\nvan and the initial group of youths was through the youths banging\nwith their hands against the vans; but they did not use bricks or petrol\nbombs or machetes; that missiles were not thrown until the vans had\nreached The Avenue and officers began to block the road; and that\nbricks began to be thrown at that point by some of the youths who\nobtained them by demolishing the wall.\n(4) The evidence is that, while cars were over-turned and set alight in\nThe Avenue, that happened after the officers from the vans had\n102\nblocked The Avenue, and not before.\n(5) The evidence from many witnesses is that the police officers in the\nvans were already in riot gear and did not withdraw to any location in\norder to put on their equipment.\n(6) The precise number of youths is difficult to determine. The\nevidence is that the initial clash with the lead van involved a small\nnumber of youths, around ten. Others followed behind them to the\njunction, but of these many ran back when the police blocked the\nroad. The numbers involved in any actions against the police in this\ninitial phase were small.\n5.34 How then do we conclude that the disturbances began? By the\nevening of 6th October, police community relations at Broadwater\nFarm had reached a very low point indeed. The youths leaving the\nestate were extremely angry. They not only knew that a Black woman\nhad died in the course of a police raid; they were also sure that senior\nofficers had not taken this death at all seriously. They were leaving\nthe estate to demonstrate their feelings outside the base of local police\npower. They are confronted by three police vans with riot protection\ncontaining police in riot gear. They express their anger by banging on\nthe side of the lead van with their hands. The police in the vans know\nthat young people have been assembling on the estate. They are\naware that their colleagues have been attacked twice during the\nafternoon. They react to the banging on the side of the van by\nimmediately calling for assistance. The nature of the call is indicated\nby the claim in the Richards report that \"they would have almost\ncertainly have been killed\". As a consequence the police response is\nmassive. It takes the form of officers in riot gear coming out of their\nvans, stopping the youths from going further and pushing them back\ninto the estate. For many of the youths this blocking of their free\nmovement at such a time is intolerable. They react to it by using any\nmeans which are available.\n5.35 Yet in the afternoon a different method of policing had been\nused. The same youths had stood and expressed their anger for 90\nminutes in front of the police station. Here, the police had accepted\nthat it was necessary to allow this to take place. We have no doubt\nthat the youths were just as angry at this time as later on when they\nwere leaving the estate. But in the afternoon there had been no\ndisturbance. Why was the response different in the evening? We have\nalready identified two very different approaches to policing in this\n103",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\narea. We have noted the disagreement of many officers with the\napproach of Chief Superintendent Couch. In the afternoon, his\nstrategy of policing was followed. In the evening, the strategy\ndeployed was one of massive force.\nTHE FIGHTING SPREADS\n5.36 The view of Cliff Ford from his twelfth floor flat in Northolt\ncovered both Willan Road to the south and Griffin Road to the east.\nFour or five minutes after he had seen people running down from\nWillan Road, he saw police at Griffin Road:-\n\"I saw them all arrive there and go straight across the road and\nblock it.\"\nWhen he saw them arrive nothing was happening at Griffin Road,\nand no barricades had been built.\n5.37 A woman whom we interviewed had seen the confrontation at\nWillan Road and decided to leave the estate with a friend by the\nGriffin Road exit where nothing was happening:-\n\"At the point of getting to Griffin Road, about eight lines of police\ncame around the corner in formation, trotting, with all their riot\nshields, and as they swooped round the corner and filled up the\nroad, my friend and I had to squeeze by on the pavement. Abuse\nwas shouted at me, like 'Black slag'.\"\nShe too was clear that there were no disturbances at Griffin Road at\nthat point.\n5.38 It seems that some of the police officers who arrived at the\nGriffin Road entrance actually came down Griffin Road and under\nthe Rochford block. Stafford Scott, after coming down from the\nWillan Road junction, says that he saw police officers emerging from\nRochford, and that a crowd rushed toward them and forced them to\nretreat back to Griffin Road. Leonardo Leon, who lives in Rochford,\nwith views from different rooms in his flat facing both south to Willan\nRoad and north towards Griffin Road, saw people moving up towards\nWillan Road and then suddenly running back. He could see police\nofficers blocking the road, bricks being thrown, and a car set alight.\nThen he heard shouting underneath Rochford. He went to the\nwindow on the north side of his flat. He then saw people pushing cars\nup, towards Griffin Road towards police lines at the mouth of Griffin\nRoad.\nOCTOBER 6- WHAT HAPPENED?\n5.39 Nick Wright and Debbie Wilde had hurried towards\nBroadwater Farm after seeing the rush of police vehicles in that\ndirection. They cut through the back streets to the Adams Road\nentrance, just to the north of Griffin Road. Nick Wright said that as\nthey arrived, various police units were also arriving, a short shield unit\nand then a long shield unit arriving in a green bus. They deployed\nacross Adams Road. There were some people in the estate on Adams\nRoad, shouting and arguing, but there was no fighting and no\nbarricades. Soon after that missiles started to be thrown and a vehicle\nwas pushed up and set alight.\n5.40 The only other entrance for vehicles onto the estate is at\nGloucester Road. A resident with a view over the Gloucester Road\nentrance smelt burning outside, at about 7 pm, and when he looked\nout saw three or four vans burning on the entrance road near the edge\nof the estate. But he could see no activity going on there at all. Indeed\nGloucester Road remained quiet for the greater part of the evening,\nand there was never the same pattern of missiles being thrown at lines\nof police officers, as was the case at the other three exits. We did not\nhave evidence as to how the three vans at the Gloucester Road\nentrance got set on fire.\n5.41 We can now examine again the statement made in the Richards\nreport that the units arriving on the scene \"found that barricades of\nblazing vehicles had been erected at all four vehicular entrances to the\nestate, and at each location they came under missile and petrol bomb\nfire as they approached.\" D.A.C. Richards relies on this allegation\nthat barricades were erected before the arrival of police, as being\nproof that this was part of a pre-arranged plan, rather than a\nspontaneous reaction to police surrounding the estate. The evidence\nwhich we have heard shows that this is not correct so far as Willan\nRoad, Griffin Road, and Adams Road are concerned. At Willan\nRoad no cars were burnt until after a large number of police officers\nwere in position across The Avenue and pushing people back towards\nthe estate. At Griffin Road the evidence of Cliff Ford, who saw the\npolice arrive, is very clear, and supported by other sources. As for\nAdams Road we had direct evidence from Nick Wright, confirmed by\nDebbie Wilde, and based on notes which they made at the time. They\nare very clear that on the arrival of the first police officers, which they\nwitnessed, there were no burning cars. Only at Gloucester Road is the\npicture unclear.\n104\n105",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHE OCTOBER 6-WHAT HAPPENED?\n5.42 The speed with which the entrances were blocked by the police\nwas remarkable. In the absence of direct police evidence we do not\nknow with certainty what messages were passed over the radio to the\nmany police units in the vicinity. The most likely explanation is there\nwas a call for urgent assistance to prevent a crowd of youths from\nleaving the estate. Whether it was a pre-arranged plan, or an\nimmediate response from the units on the spot, the fact is that the\nexits were blocked. When they were, the youth on the estate felt even\nmore the sense of being trapped and under siege. It was in those\ncircumstances that they began to push cars toward the police lines and\nset them alight. It was then that the fighting at Griffin Road and\nAdams Road, which was the fiercest in the whole area, began.\nTHE ACTIONS OF THE CROWD\n5.43\nThe fiercest encounters were at Griffin Road and Adams Road,\nand they took on a pattern which continued for many hours from soon\nafter 7.00 pm to about 10.30 pm. From the side of those on the estate,\nthere were constant volleys of dangerous missiles. Slabs of pavement\nwere broken up and thrown. When the available slabs from nearby\nwere used up, young people were seen rushing through the estate\ncarrying missiles in various containers. A shopping trolley, a milk\ncrate, and a large communal rubbish bin were all mentioned to us as\nbeing used. At a later stage, tins stolen from the supermarket became\na common form of ammunition.\n5.44 Many petrol bombs were thrown. On the clear evidence that we\nhave, they were crudely and hurriedly made on the spot, not carefully\nprepared beforehand. Leonardo Leon, looking from the Rochford\nblock over the Griffin Road area, saw:-\n\"People with bottles, then some people syphoning off fuel from\ncars, three or four people laughing and putting cloth inside. There\nwas a white cloth, a large piece, and they were tearing it apart and\nthen putting it into the bottles, and throwing it. But of ten bottles\nthey threw, one of them would actually light up and land in the\nroad. All the others would just be nothing.\"\nMichael Keith, a research assistant at St Katherine's College,\nOxford, had been preparing a history of rioting. He went to\nTottenham after hearing of the death of Mrs Jarrett. He witnessed the\ndisturbances both from outside and inside the estate, and later in the\nsurrounding streets and the High Road. He saw how easy it was to\nmake petrol bombs while he was watching the action in the streets\n106\noutside the estate:-\n\"Two people, both Black, started shouting orders at the others: 'we\nneed more ammunition'. Immediately five or six responded by\nrunning round the houses gathering up empty milk bottles, while\nfour others turned over a car for petrol. In less than five minutes I\ncounted more than 50 petrol bombs completed.\"\n5.45 We conclude that it was entirely possible for many petrol\nbombs to have been assembled within a short time. In a large estate\nthere were many milk bottles ready to hand which could be quickly\ngathered. People were seen to fill them on the spot. We have no\nevidence whatever that they were prepared beforehand. In the light of\nthis we have considered with care that prosecution reports of the\nstatement made on behalf of the in Court on the 12th June that\n\"petrol bombs were prepared in advance and stored\". On all the\nevidence, we consider this to be both unproven and unlikely.\n5.46 A great number of cars were burned. 47 wrecked vehicles were\nlater removed from the estate by the council's contractor. Many of\nthese were in the Griffin and Adams road area. Mr and Mrs Kemp,\nwatching from their flat in the Rochford block, counted at least eight\nor nine in Griffin Road. As one burned out, another was set on fire.\nA mini-bus was pushed out from one of the schools and burned. A\nrubbish skip in Adams Road was also set on fire.\n5.47 One building on the corner of Adams Road at its closest point\nto the edge of the estate was burned out. Families living in the\nmaisonettes in the building were evacuated.\nThey were not injured, but they must have suffered a terrible\nexperience. We have no evidence as to how that house caught fire. It\nwas situated beside the centre of the action in Adams Road, by the\narea of road where cars were set on fire. The Richards report states\nthat the house was set on fire \"as the result of the actions of the\nrioters in petrol bombing the cars outside.\"\n5.48 Many of those involved in the actions against the police wore\nmasks or scarves to disguise themselves. But several of the people\nwho we interviewed who lived in flats overlooking Griffin Road were\nsure that there were many strangers among them, both Black and\nWhite. Leonardo Leon gave a vivid picture of four strangers who\nplayed a prominent part:-\nww noising and\n107",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\n\"It was like when you look at ants, you see how ants move and you\nidentify which ones are the soldiers and which ones are the\nworkers. Because you see them from high. Now what I saw was\nthree or four people moving and giving signs to each other with\ntheir hands. They were people in bomber jackets with trainers and\njeans. I cannot say absolutely for sure if they were White, but I\nthink they were White. And they were moving like a group. You\ncould see they were White by their hands.\"\nOne other woman, a retired White woman whom we interviewed,\nwho was watching from Hawkinge block, was also struck by a group\nof four White men:-\n\"There were these four White young men that I would call the thug\ntype, they came from under Lympne, and they had on their heads\nthese hoods.\"\nShe described how she could see they were White from their hands,\nand from the fair hair of one who took his hood off. They had petrol\nbombs in their hands. She continued:-\n\"I can't describe the hatred that I felt on that night, that I still feel,\nfor those four Whites that I saw. They were outsiders doing it to\nour estate.\"\n5.49 However from the general pattern of the evidence, it is\nimpossible to say that people were being \"organised\" or \"led\". Some\npeople were more active than others. Some threw missiles, some\nshouted, some just watched. Michael Keith had the strong impression\nthat all were united in their anger against the police. He said this on\nthe question of “organisation\":-\n\"Most of the people were united by a sense of anger which\nregularly escalated to fury. In this situation a dramatic cast,\nrepresentative of any cross-section of society was clearly evident.\nHere were the people who were 'all mouth', loudest in the cries of\nabuse, standing furthest away from the police lines, throwing the\noccasional brick from the safe distance of a 100 yards or more.\nOthers were more committed, outdoing one another in their attacks\non police, going as close as 30, 20 or ten yards away from police\nlines before throwing brick, bomb or baked bean can. Many more\nspent most of the time giving moral support, joking with each\nother, but no less committed in occasional forays against the rows\nof riot shields. Amidst all these characters, there inevitably emerge\nthose who try and impose some order upon confused actions. In\nthis sense organisation was extemporised.\"animos maly\n108\nOCTOBER 6-WHAT HAPPENED?\nThere was evidence that some people had whistles, and one person\nhad a bell, which fitted this pattern of \"extemporised organisation\".\nArthur Lawrence of the West Indian Leadership Council, who with\nhis colleagues walked around both inside and outside the estate, gave\nsimilar evidence of people supporting each other in a loosely\norganised way: -\nbla\n\"When people thought that their lines were a bit thin, then they\nwent to reinforce the lines, running from one point to another.\nThere were no generals.\"\n5.50 Two of the schools next to the estate to the north of Adams\nRoad were damaged and property was stolen. The Moselle School\nhad extensive damage to glass and doors and the loss of seven\ncomputers, a television and other equipment, and a large\nphotocopier. We have no evidence as to who removed such bulky\nitems. Both the William C. Harvey School and the Broadwater Farm\nJunior School had damage to windows and doors, and some\nequipment stolen. On the Tangmere block, as we shall describe in\nmore detail, the supermarket and newsagent's shop were broken\nopen, looted and burned, and one flat was ransacked. Many of the\nlights on the estate were broken. That, plus the burning of cars, was\nthe extent of property damage, and there were no attacks on residents\nof the estate.\n5.51 The actions which we have described so far all concern the\nGriffin Road/Adams Road area. At Willan Road, after the police had\nblocked off The Avenue, the action had started with the throwing of\nbricks from the demolished garden wall. A local resident was struck\nby how young they were. She saw \"kids of 12 and 13\" and no older\nmen though generally people spoke of young people of a variety of\nages taking part. Arthur Lawrence spoke of about 30 youths being\ninvolved at Willan Road. People who lived in the Avenue were.\ncoming out and trying to move their cars, and it seems that\nsurprisingly little damage was done to cars in The Avenue area. After\na time, the brick throwing eased off and the police were able to block\nthe top of Willan Road, where they were preventing people from\nentering and leaving the estate. Nick Wright observed a \"second\nconfrontation\" at Willan Road at about 8.45 pm, which worried the\npolice because they thought that they had secured that area. In\ngeneral there was no sustained attack after the initial confrontation;\nrather there were intermittent forays.\n109",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nOCTOBER 6-WHAT HAPPENED?\nTHE ACTIONS OF THE POLICE\n5.52 For hour after hour at Griffin Road and Adams Road the\npolice stood in their lines across the road, behind their long perspex\nshields, passively fending off the missiles which came at them. From\ntime to time they would advance a short distance, 40 or 50 yards, and\nthen retreat again. Occasionally the short shield squads made what\none witness called \"half hearted sorties\" towards the estate; but the\ndifficulty was that the space was too confined for the short shield\nofficers to be covered by long shield units. The short shield units are\nintended to be \"snatch squads\" who make arrests, but on this\noccasion hardly any arrests were made. We understand from police\nsources that on one occasion a small unit did succeed in getting into\nthe estate and staying there for about half an hour, but it had no\nsupport and eventually was forced to retreat. The officers beat on\ntheir shields in unison and gave voice to a cry that was described as\n\"the gorilla chant of the football terraces\", \"oooh oooh noises\", \"a\nzulu war cry\". The evidence which we heard from many onlookers.\nfully confirmed the statements made in the Police Review in October\n1985 that officers were \"required to crouch behind static lines of long\nshields to become Aunt Sallys of the petrol bombers\".\nno adgil\n5.53 We have no doubt that for the officers who were required to\nstand in this way the experience was terrifying. Directly opposite the\nGriffin Road and Adams Road corners were the elevated balconies of\nthe Rochford and Martlesham blocks; and although most of the\nmissiles came from ground level, some also were hurled from above.\nFire extinguishers began to run short, and according to a journalist\nclose to the police lines the officers were told not to use fire\nextinguishers to put out petrol bomb fires, but only if a person was\nburnt. Some officers became more confident at their success in batting\ndown the missiles with their shields, and some hurled missiles back\ninto the crowd. But any confidence turned back to fear when, as we\nshall describe, it became known that gun shots had been fired.\nHoward Simmons, the council's head of community affairs, described\nthe officers behind the lines along Mount Pleasant Road:-\n\"A considerable number of police were stood down. They were\nstanding around looking shaken, looking exhausted. Some of the\npolice were lying on the pavement, stacking their shields up in\npeople's front gardens. There was an immense emotional feel\namongst the police in that area.\"\n110\n5.54 At Willan Road, where the police had more of the upper hand,\nmuch more aggression and abuse was directed at Black people, many\nof whom were trying to get in or out of the estate. It was there that\nSteve Platt, reporting for New Society, overheard some disgusting\nracial abuse:-\n\"A Black couple trying to leave the area via Willan Road were\nturned back at the police lines, to a chorus of the monkey noises\nused to abuse Black footballers by racists at soccer matches. 'Fuck\noff niggers' yelled one of the policemen 'Go and live in the zoo.\n'You can burn that down.' 'Get back in your rat hole, vermin,\"\nechoed another. 'We'll be in to get you soon enough'.\"\nOther witnesses spoke of similar shouts. A woman resident in The\nAvenue spoke of police \"riling up the kids\" with cries of \"you wogs,\nyou vermin\". Whatever the circumstances, racist abuse of this nature\nis wholly unacceptable in a force which even under pressure should be\ndisciplined and impartial.\n5.55 At the Gloucester Road entrance the situation was far more\ncalm and controlled. The officer in charge at Gloucester Road was\nChief Superintendent Couch. In contrast to the other entrances many\npeople were able to get in and out through Gloucester Road without\nbeing stopped or harassed. Many of the officers there were not in riot\ngear. Arthur Lawrence and his colleagues from the West Indian\nLeadership Council made their way to Gloucester Road around 7.45\npm, and spoke to Chief Superintendent Couch. He said that he was\nglad to see them and asked them to do something to help calm the\nsituation. They went down The Avenue towards Willan Road, where\nthey saw a police van moving towards the crowd at the junction. They\nwent back to Chief Superintendent Couch and asked him to withdraw\nthe van as it was aggravating the situation. Chief Superintendent\nCouch agreed. They went back and the same thing happened - two\nvans were moving into the crowd. This time Chief Superintendent\nCouch said that he couldn't give them instructions, as they were not\nunder his control. Chief Superintendent Couch continued to ask help\nfrom the community leaders by asking them to try to ensure that no\nhouses were set on fire. Arthur Lawrence's group did in fact secure an\nundertaking from the crowd at Willan Road that no property would\nbe set on fire.\n5.56 The evidence of Mr Lawrence and his colleagues, and the lack\nof confrontation at Gloucester Road, indicates clearly to us that there\n111",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nOCTOBER 6- WHAT HAPPENED?\nwas sensible leadership in that location which could act flexibly to\nminimise the trouble. Unfortunately it appears that the police\nleadership at the other locations was not of the same quality, and at\nGriffin Road and Adams Road appeared not to be in control of the\nsituation at all. Howard Simmons walked down Mount Pleasant Road\nbetween about 8.30 to 9.00 pm identifying himself as a senior\ncouncil official and trying to find someone in command. The junior\nofficers whom he spoke to were in a state of confusion and had no\nidea where the control point was. He said: -\n\"My view on the night was that the chain of command and\ncommunication between police was virtually non-existent. The\npolice themselves did not know what was going on. I was staggered\nto find them standing shoulder to shoulder about ten deep in\nreceipt of all these missiles, but clearly they were going to sustain\nsubstantial injuries. God knows what their senior officers thought\nthey were doing.\"\n5.57 The junior officers believed that they could and should have\ngone into the estate with maximum force and subdued it. They said so\nin the pages of the October 1985 Police Review. They were saying so\non the night. A journalist heard an officer who had served with the\nRoyal Ulster Constabulary in Belfast say that they should have used\nplastic bullets to disperse the crowd and then move into the estate for\n\"search and seize\".\n-\n5.58 We are in a state of some uncertainty as to who, if anyone,\ntook overall charge of the night's operations. The Richards report\nstates that there were four senior officers - Couch, Sinclair, French,\nand Rowe who took command at each of the four main locations.\nTwo hours later Chief Superintendent Jeffers took over at Griffin\nRoad. Above them there were high ranking officers at the district\nheadquarters at Wood Green, the area headquarters at Chigwell, and\nthe Metropolitan headquarters at Scotland Yard. According to a\nreport in The Job magazine, traffic on the police radio wavelengths\nwas seriously overloaded, so that clear commands could not be issued\nand implemented. This information was confirmed from fire brigade\nsources, for their operations too were affected. According to their\nreport, they had a senior officer in the Wood Green Police control\nroom who experienced considerable difficulty because no facilities\nwere provided for a brigade radio to be installed, and so he was out of\ntouch for much of the time with the brigade's involvement. At the\n112\ntime of finalising this report we had not had sight of the report of the\nMetropolitan Police's internal review of the disturbances, which may\nprovide, if published, more information about the chain of command\non the night. Our view on the evidence available is of confusion,\nwhich was likely to lead to unnecessary danger to officers in front\nlines, and to minimise the chances of scaling down the confrontation.\n5.59 It is difficult without police evidence to determine the total\nnumbers of police officers involved on 6th October. Lord Gifford\nasked for this information in a parliamentary question, and received\nthis reply from Lord Glenarthur:-bi\n\"I understand from the Commissioner that the number of officers\ndeployed at the Broadwater Farm Estate on 6th October 1985\nvaried as the disturbances developed. At 10 o'clock pm, some three\nhours after the riot began, about 600 police officers, drawn from all\nareas of the Metropolitan Police district, were deployed in the\nvicinity of the Broadwater Farm estate.\"\nThe answer is incomplete, and we are not told whether the time\nchosen of 10 pm was the time when the maximum number of officers\nwas deployed. Further information is available from the report of the\nCommissioner for 1985, in which it is stated that \"nearly 2000 officers\nwere available for deployment within four hours of the outbreak of\nviolence\". As to the numbers injured, Lord Glenarthur in another\nparliamentary answer said that 71 officers required treatment in\nhospital, of whom 17 were detained for longer than 24 hours.\n'LAKES OF PETROL'\n5.60 The Richards report contains two references to lakes or floods\nof petrol. In seeking to justify the police strategy of \"containment\",\nthe report states:-\n\"Any concerted effort to advance into the body of the estate (in\nwhich lakes of petrol were seen) could well have resulted in death\nor serious injury to police and/or members of the public.\"\nLater in the context of dealing with the anti-police character of the\nattacks, the report states that:-\n\"Subsequent inquiries reveal allegations that some basement garage\nareas on the estate had been flooded with petrol, for the alleged\npurpose of use in the event of an incursion by police.\"\n113",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nPredictably these references became banner headlines when the\nreport was leaked to the press.\n5.61 At the meeting of the Community and Police Consultative\nGroup on 13th March 1986, which was attended by members of our\npanel, D.A.C. Richards was asked directly by Councillor Mitchell\nwhether there were any lakes of petrol. In answer D.A.C. Richards\nsaid that people had had plastic bags of petrol and two litre bottles\nwhich were lobbed to the police lines. The police were confronted by\nsheets of petrol which came about from these bags bursting in the\nbasement area. There was evidence of a police officer who finished up\nin a deep puddle of petrol. A civilian witness had said that petrol was\npoured down the stairs to the garage area. Some petrol was set alight\nand the flames shot towards police officers. Councillor Mitchell asked\nhim whether he had therefore withdrawn his allegation about lakes of\npetrol. D.A.C. Richards said that he had corrected statements in the\npress. There had been a misunderstanding. The allegations of floods\nof petrol were made after the event. A further statement was made by\nD.A.C. Richards in a letter to the Police Review on January 24th\n1986, which mentions evidence of a police constable about the plastic\nbags, and continued:-\n\"He saw an expanse of petrol which he estimated was equivalent to\na car's full tank of petrol. He then sustained serious injury and fell\nto the ground in what he once more thought to be water. However\nhis footwear and clothing were saturated with petrol.\"\n5.62 We have concluded that there have been two quite separate\nallegations made about petrol which, whether deliberately or not,\nhave become confused. On one hand, there was undoubtedly a\nquantity of petrol on the ground and in various places, particularly\naround Griffin Road and Adams Road, because of the actions of\nmembers of the crowd in throwing petrol bombs and possibly other\npetrol filled missiles, many of which did not ignite when landing. The\nfire brigade report contains a contemporary record from Adams Road\nat 9.20 pm saying \"copious amounts of petrol spread on the road\nunignited at this time\". These quantities which D.A.C. Richards more\naccurately referred to as \"puddles\", clearly represented a danger of\ninjury if they were to ignite.\n5.63 On the other hand the use of the word \"lakes\" was clearly\ncalculated to convey the impression that whole expanses of the\n114\nтяс\nOCTOBER 6- WHAT HAPPENED?\nbasement car-parks were awash with petrol which had been spilled\ndeliberately by people in the estate in order to be ignited and burn up\npolice officers if they came into the estate. If this were true, it would\nhave been a horrific plan. But it was not true, and D.A.C. Richards in\nhis reply to Councillor Mitchell appears to accept that. As members of\nthe council's Building Design Service have observed to us, there are\nno \"basement garage areas\". The under-deck parking spaces could\nnot have been turned into \"lakes of petrol\" without the construction\nof additional walls and the blocking of rainwater gullies. The\nreference in the report to \"lakes\" was therefore grossly misleading.\nGUN SHOTS AND FIRE ARMS\n5.64 The Richards report states that at 7.55 pm an officer deployed\nat Griffin Road sustained a bullet hole in his shield, and shortly\nafterwards a police officer was found to have been struck in the body\nby a bullet. The report states that following this, at least one shotgun\nwas fired in Griffin Road and several officers and two BBC\ncameramen sustained pellet wounds, fortunately none serious; and\nthat one officer experienced in the use of firearms said that he heard a\nshotgun fired more than 30 times in the Griffin Road area. Seven\npeople whom we interviewed in our door-to-door inquiries had heard\ngun shots, in each case two to three shots. Those who gave a time put\nit between 9 and 10.30 pm. Two people said that the shots came from\nthe Rochford area. A journalist whom we interviewed was behind the\nlines at Griffin Road at about 9.30 when he heard a gunshot sound\nand saw that a BBC cameraman had fallen. He had \"pepper shot\"\nacross his face and upper body and his chest was bleeding. He noticed\nalso that a riot shield had been peppered with shot. There is no doubt\nat all that a shotgun was fired, but we do not accept the suggestion of\n30 shots made in the Richards report. The number of people hit\nwould suggest a very low number of shots. We have no direct\nevidence of the bullet shot, but we have no reason to dispute the facts\ngiven in the Richards report. A riot shield pierced by a bullet was\nshown to the press, and it was reported that surgeons had removed a\nbullet from the stomach of the police officer.\n5.65 The Richards report states that officers from D11 Branch, the\nforce's firearms unit, were alerted soon after 8.00pm and sent to\nTottenham to stand by. It states that at 9.45 pm the Commissioner\nauthorised the use of baton rounds (plastic bullets) and/ or CS gas as a\nlast resort, and that the officers equipped with these weapons arrived\n115",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nat Griffin Road at about 10.20 pm. In the event, the baton rounds and\nCS gas were never used. Howard Simmons saw a section of police\narmed with plastic bullet launchers march past him and stand behind\nthe cordon. He thought the time was about 9.45 pm. In an interview\non the TV Eye programme four nights later, Chief Superintendent\nCouch said that he had been authorised to use baton round and CS\ngas but he had been concerned for the public; and that if he had used\nthe ultimate weapons, the bridge would have been more difficult to\nbuild. However, the Richards report suggests that the reason why\nthey were not used was because \"the severity of the attack had\nlessened considerably\" by the time that the team arrived.\n5.66 There were also police marksmen on the scene. The police had\nbeen given access to one of the houses in Mount Pleasant Road which\nbacked onto the estate, and were looking through windows at the\nback. They had set up an infra-red night sight, and an officer looking\nthrough the sight claimed to have identified someone on a balcony in\nthe Rochford block. He said to a senior officer: \"We could take him\nout.\" The senior officer replied: \"No, there is no question of that, we\nare not doing that\". There was a heated exchange between the two\nofficers.\nTHE SHOPS ON TANGMERE\n5.67 On the Tangmere precinct there was a supermarket and a\nnewsagent's shop, side by side. At about 9.30 pm Arthur Lawrence\nand his colleagues went into the estate by the Gloucester Road\nentrance. Superintendent Dick Stacey had seen them at the\nGloucester Road entrance and had told them that he believed there\nwas looting on the Tangmere precinct. He asked them to go and see if\nthis was the case. Mr Lawrence and his colleagues felt that it was the\npolice's duty to investigate looting. Even so, they went into the estate.\nOne of the remarkable features of the evening is the way in which\nArthur Lawrence, George Martin, and Vernon Moore, and (for the\nearlier part) one other man, went about the scene throughout the\nwhole evening and night, apart from one short break for a snack,\nquietly helping to calm things if they could. We have seen how they\nhelped Chief Superintendent Couch on The Avenue. Later on \"four\nwell dressed Black gentleman\" obviously the same group - were\nseen by Mr and Mrs Kemp to be talking quietly to people at Griffin\nRoad. And later in the night on Tangmere, as we shall see, their\nactions almost certainly saved many lives.\n-\n116\nOCTOBER 6-WHAT HAPPENED?\n5.68 When they reached the precinct, they saw that both the\nnewsagent's and the supermarket had been broken into. People,\nBlack and White, were \"running in and out of the supermarket with\nbags of goodies\". They spoke to seven or eight of them, and told\nthem it was not right to do that. There was a child of eight or nine\nwith a carrier bag. There was \"this little White kid with two carrier\nbags\" saying to his mother \"Mum, what shall I do with this?\". There\nwas another White boy with a suitcase full of groceries who said that\nhe didn't live on the estate, but in Downhills Park:-\n\"When he spoke I discovered he was an Irish boy and he said that\nit's the first time he has had so much food in six months because\nhe's unemployed.\"\nOthers looted the shops for ammunition such as cans and bottles to\nthrow at the police.\n5.69 Arthur Lawrence and his colleagues went over to the Griffin\nRoad area and observed the scene there for a while. They came back\nto Tangmere around 10.00 pm and saw smoke and a few flames.\ncoming from the newsagent. It was a small fire, and they thought that\nsomebody tried to put it out. Unfortunately they did not stay on the\nprecinct, but went back over to Griffin Road, and then out of the\nestate by the Willan Road exit. They were very hungry and went to\nthe High Road for something to eat. They came back to the estate\nbetween about 11.30 pm and 12 pm by the Gloucester Road entrance.\nThe period during which they had been away had seen the tragedy of\nPC Keith Blakelock's death. He had been sent into the estate with\nother officers to protect the fire brigade as they put out the fire in the\nTangmere shop. As stated earlier, we can make no comment about\nthis tragic episode because of the sub judice rule.\n5.70 By this time Roy Limb and Dolly Kiffin had returned to the\nestate. They had left after the Youth Association meeting in order to\nattend a reception for Mike Henry, the Jamaican Minister of Culture,\nwho had been visiting Haringey. They had hurried back from the\nreception when they had learned of the intensity of the disturbances.\nArthur Lawrence and his colleagues spent some time escorting Roy\nLimb onto the estate and later off again. Arthur Lawrence, George\nMartin, and Vernon Moore remained around the Tangmere precinct.\nIt was by now after 1 am. The precinct was full of water from the\nprevious actions of the fire brigade, and a fire hose was still there.\n117",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\n5.71 Suddenly George Martin saw a frightening sight: -!\n\"There were three White youths and they were going in and out of\nthe supermarket and the tobacconist's shop, catching the place fire.\nI see fire start to come up from one end of it. I keep chasing back\nand forward to this fire. I say to them, you are catching this place\nafire. They were doing it with matches. Eventually the one in the\ntobacconist's became the largest fire.\"\nDolly Kiffin was in her office inside the Youth Association.\nThrough the window, which looks over the precinct, she too saw the\nfire started:-\n\"I saw three men, one blonde, a fattish one, and the next one, he\nthrew something in the paper shop, it came red, and then bang\nthe fire was raging.\n-\n-\n5.72 We accept the evidence of George Martin and Dolly Kiffen that\nthis fire was deliberately started by three White youths. Mr Martin in\nparticular was very clear about his observations. Other witnessess\nincluding Arthur Lawrence saw the White youths one witness\ndescribed them as \"three White skinheads\" - but did not actually see\nthem start the fire. The possible implications of this evidence are\nfrightening. There were, as the fire brigade confirmed in their report,\nexposed gas pipes in the newsagent's shop, which is presumably why it\ncaught fire again after the previous fire had been doused. Who were\nthese three White youths? Why were they doing this? Had they been\nresponsible for the earlier fire in the shop? It is worth noting that\njournalist David Whitfield saw a group of White youths in The\nAvenue at around 1.00 am who may be the same group. They stood\nout as being a group that were not making common cause with Black\nyouths. He told us: -\n\"What was interesting was that there were Black and White young\npeople on the streets together. At one stage I'd seen a bunch of\nWhite youths and I was a bit nervous because I didn't know\nwhether they were facists. But what was clear was that there were a\nlot of Blacks and Whites on the streets together mixed in with no\nanimosity. Apart from these boys who didn't look too pleasant.\"\n5.73 Dolly Kiffin ran out with fire extinguishers from the Youth\nAssociation, and Arthur Lawrence and George Martin tried in vain to\nput the fire out. They went back to Gloucester Road and asked the\nfire officer to turn the hose back on. But it was twisted and there was\nno pressure. The fire was burning fiercely with flames coming out of\n118\nтя\nOCTOBER 6- WHAT HAPPENED?\n-\nthe top and smoke spreading upstairs. George Martin and a youth\nwent upstairs and knocked on the doors upstairs to get people out,\nbut nobody came. By now there was a large group of 30 or 40 youths\naround the precinct, and George Martin argued with them to get the\nfire brigade in, and eventually they agreed. The three men - Arthur\nLawrence, George Martin, and Vernon Moore went back to the\nfire officer and told him that the fire was getting out of hand. The\nfireman asked: \"Can you guarantee our safety?\" There were several\ntrips backwards and forward between the fire officer and the youths\non Tangmere, and George Martin was finally able to say: \"We can\nguarantee that they won't interfere with you\". The fire officers\nassured the community leaders that only they and no police would\ncome onto Tangmere. George Martin gave this account of the arrival\nof the firemen:-\n\"I then went upstairs and I said to all the youths who were literally\ntrying to put out the fire to move away and go over the far side and\nwait. And I managed to get them all over there and then I shout to\nthe fire officer to come upstairs. Then myself, Mr Lawrence and\nMr Moore stand between the fire officers and where the youths\nwere standing.\"\n5.74 Eventually, after more trips in and out with hoses, the fire was\nput out, except for the gas pipe that remained alight but safe. We pay\nthe highest tribute to George Martin, Arthur Lawrence and Vernon\nMoore for this action which they took; and also to the fire officers and\nthe senior officers of police who responded to the negotiations in the\nknowledge of what had happened to PC Blakelock on the occasion of\nthe earlier fire. The fire had reached a stage of intense danger. Sheila\nRamdin lives below the newsagent. The room where her children\nwere asleep was filling up with smoke when she went in and got them\nout. As she said to us:-\n\"If the fire brigade never come, the whole of Tangmere would have\njust caught alight.\"\nTHE ENTRY OF THE POLICE\n5.75 Long before the episode of the second fire, the conflict had\nbeen dying away. Sometime before 11.00 pm a police helicopter had\narrived overhead, shining a strong beam of light, and causing youths\nto take cover to avoid identification. After 11.00 pm it began to rain.\nRoy Limb had persuaded Chief Superintendent Couch that the news\nof the officer's death ought to be communicated to the youths inside.\n119",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nOCTOBER 6- WHAT HAPPENED?\nWhen George Martin and Arthur Lawrence escorted him on to the\nestate, it was to give Dolly Kiffin that message, and she passed it on.\nFor all these reasons the fighting ended, but the ranks of police\nremained for many hours at the entrances to the estate.\n5.76 There were a number of incidents off the estate in the latter\npart of the evening. Michael Keith had left the estate around 10.30 to\n11 pm and witnessed severe attacks on the police line in Mount\nPleasant Road from Wimborne Road. A garden wall along Wimborne\nRoad was rocked and demolished for further ammunition to throw at\nthe police. A car was turned over and an unsuccessful attempt made\nto light it. Michael Keith counted over 200 people, the majority\ninvolved in verbal abuse, a minority doing the brunt of the attacking.\nFor over an hour police officers moved backwards and forwards\nagainst this crowd and eventually forced them away from the estate\nthrough the surrounding residential streets. They finally reached\nBruce Grove and the High Road, for a further half hour the police\nwere seen to be clearing people from the High Road in a fairly violent\nway, causing injury to at least two bystanders.\n5.77 At 4.30 am a massive number of police in riot gear entered the\nestate. The estate was by now completely quiet; many of those who\nhad taken part would have been able to leave across the Lordship\nRecreation Ground, which was never sealed off by the police. A great\nnumber of the officers came up the steps onto the precinct of\nTangmere. Arthur Lawrence, George Martin, Vernon Moore, Dolly\nKiffen and about six youths were in the Youth Association premises,\nsome of them taking a nap. They saw the officers arrive, with the\nCommunity Liaison Officer Superintendant Stacey in front. George\nMartin described what he then saw:-\n\"I was standing at the door of the Youth Association, and we saw\nthe police as they came upstairs, and they went towards the\nsupermarket, and I saw one of them hitting something. I was trying\nto see but it was in darkness. He had a shield and he had a baton.\nHe was hitting this thing, down like this. Eventually when I\nmanaged to look, he picked this thing up and chained it against the\ndoor. Then I realised it was a young chap.\"\nArthur Lawrence saw two youths being beaten. He said that the\npolice had found them inside the shop, and beat them \"with\ntruncheons and kicks and that sort of thing\".\n120\n5.78 The officers came up to the glass door of the Youth\nAssociation, and asked Arthur Lawrence to open up. He had not got\nthe keys, and one of the youths went upstairs to get them from Dolly\nKiffin. Before she came down, the officers smashed through the glass\nwith their truncheons. The community leaders were surrounded by\nofficers in riot gear armed with plastic bullet launchers. Arthur\nLawrence said:-\n\"By that time I was having 10,000 butterflies, because I thought my\nnumber had been called, because things were being pointed at us.'\nGeorge Martin told us, \"at that time I thought we had had it, quite\nhonestly\". Vernon Moore told us that an officer shook a truncheon in\nhis face. There was a youth in the building, and the officers took him\nout onto the precinct. Authur Lawrence described what he then\nsaw:-\n\"They kicked and punched and throw him on the floor and\nstamped on him, kneed him. Then they hung his head over the\nbalcony.\"\nThe officers then spread out and took positions, occupying the\nwhole estate.\nCONCLUSION\n5.79 It will be apparent from this chapter that during the evening of\n6th October there were many people involved in many different kinds\nof action. Some were trying to use their position as community leaders\nto be intermediaries with the authorities, as far as they were able to\nbe. Some were looking on, and we have heard many stories of\nresidents coming out on to the balconies and chatting to the youths\nwho were more directly involved. Some threw missiles of various\ndescriptions, and set cars on fire. Some, for reasons which may have\nbeen entirely separate and personal to themselves, broke into the\nschools and stole equipment. Some looted the shops for ammunition;\nothers looted simply to steal food. Some were prepared to commit\narson which endangered life. Some were prepared to endanger life by\nshooting.\n5.80 Some of the actions done that night were shocking and\ninexcusable. But many of the actions were not condemned by many\nwitnesses. They said that the youths were defending themselves\nagainst officers who had first interfered with their right to walk to the\npolice station, and then were frightened to enter the estate and attack\nthem in force.

            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nwhich featured pictures of the rioting and headlines about the death of\nthe policeman. On Monday the journalists' job was to discover the\nbackground to what had happened. Their efforts, as printed in the\npapers of 8th October, make sorry reading. A frequent theme was\nthat the whole event was organised by left wing agitators:-\n\"STREET FIGHTING EXPERTS TRAINED IN MOSCOW AND\nLIBYA WERE BEHIND BRITAIN'S WORST VIOLENCE.\"\n(Daily Express)\n\"THE TOTTENHAM RIOT WAS IGNITED BY WELL\nPREPARED OUTSIDERS.\" (Daily Mirror)\nThe responsiblity for this theme must be taken by the\nCommissioner Sir Kenneth Newman, who at a press conference on\n7th October said;-\n\"Groups of trotskyists and anarchists had been identified as\norchestrating the disturbances in Tottenham and in Brixton a week\nearlier. They are both Black and White and come from within and\noutside London, operating in areas of ethnic concentration.\"\nIt was highly irresponsible for the Commissioner to make this\nstatement at a time when the investigations into the Tottenham\ndisturbances had scarcely begun. As it turned out, within ten days, the\npolice had completely discounted this theory. The London Standard\nreported on 17th October:-\n\"No evidence of agitation before the riot by politically inspired\ngroups had been found by police. A Scotland Yard spokesman said:\n'We don't believe outside agitators were responsible for what\nhappened in Tottenham'.\"\nBut many more people must have read the original headlines than\nread the later retraction. Prejudices were fed, and distress and anxiety\ncaused, by a statement which should never have been made.\n6.3 A second theme was the picture of Broadwater Farm as a hellish\nplace of criminal activity and racial hatred: -\n\"A daily war being waged against White families by the younger\nmembers of a burgeoning Black community who occupy virtually\nall the flats in the 12 blocks of grey, stained concrete that make up\nthe divided zone.\" (Daily Mail, 8th October)\n\"The local name for the 12 blocks of flats there is Alcatraz, and if\nyou are poor and White, old and ill, it's a vicious and frightening\nprison. White people there do feel they are living in an alien and\nterrifying land and nobody will even listen to them, let alone help\nthem.\" (Daily Mail, 9th October)\n124\nTHE AFTERMATH\n\"They sit there, these gaunt tower blocks, like citadels of\ndisillusion. They are scruffy. They are battered. They smell.\"\n(Daily Mirror, under the headline \"Living hell\".)\nAn Asian man whom we interviewed described the attitude of\nreporters who spoke to him on the Monday:-\n\"When the newspapers interviewed me the next day, they wanted\nme to say it was Black against White. When I said it wasn't, they\ndidn't really want to know anything. It didn't make headlines.\"\nCliff Ford, an estate sweeper and active Tenants' Association.\nmember, tried to exercise a right of reply: -\n\"I wrote to the Daily Mail myself and said, 'what about the\nChristmas dinners, the social things that the Youth Association\ndoes?' They didn't want to know about that, they never published\nthat at all.\"\nAn article in the Times headed \"THE ESTATE THAT DOLLY\nKIFFIN RESCUED FROM NIGHTMARE\" stands out as being a\nserious effort to describe the achievements of the Broadwater Farm\ncommunity. Neale Coleman, Neighbourhood Officer, spoke of the\n\"considerable anger\" among residents about the reports in most of\nthe newspapers, and added that the television and radio tended to be\nmore responsible.\n6.4 The racist theme which appears in some of the reports which we\nhave quoted White people being hated and terrorised by Black -\nwas reinforced by headlines about \"hyenas\", \"butchers\", and\n\"monsters\". It became personalised in a particularly unpleasant way\naround Councillor Bernie Grant. A report in the Sun of 9th October,\nunder the headline \"DON'T CALL ME BARMY BERNIE\", describes\nCouncillor Grant as \"peeling a banana and juggling with an orange\".\nAn unnamed Labour councillor is quoted in the report as saying\nthat:-\n\"Bernie Grant is like the leader of a Black tribe always looking\nfor battles and shaking his spear. He sees all Whites as his enemy.\"\nThis kind of reporting had nothing to do with criticism of Councillor\nGrant's statements, which we analyse below. The crude images of\nCouncillor Grant as being a madman from the jungle were\ninexcusable, and they were to continue for months.\n6.5 One theme which did not feature prominently in the newspapers\nwas any serious analysis of how Mrs Jarrett's home came to be\nsearched or what happened there, nor any of the wider issues about\n125",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHOL\nTHE AFTERMATH\npolicing in Tottenham. On 7th October a number of newspapers had\nprinted the two conflicting versions of the circumstances of her death.\nBy 8th October virtually all the press coverage centred on the hatred\nand the violence of rioters towards the police. There was little attempt\nmade to understand why it was (apart from the \"agitators\" theory)\nthat so much hatred was felt. Exceptions were the Guardian and the\nMorning Star, who on 8th October both printed detailed reports about\nthe raid on the Jarrett home.\n6.6 On 7th October Councillor Bernie Grant spoke at a press\nconference. He gave the press a number of details about the raid on\nMrs Jarrett's home. He was asked if he condemned the violence of the\nriots and replied:-\n\"I find it difficult to condemn anybody for what happened after the\ndeath of an innocent woman.\"\nIn answer to questions about the murder of PC Blakelock, he\nsaid:-\n\"I don't know anything about it...maybe it was a policeman who\nstabbed another policeman. I don't know the circumstances of it\nand I do not wish to get involved in it.\"\nOn the following day, 8th October, there was an open air meeting\ngoing on outside Tottenham Town Hall. Councillor Grant was visiting\nthe Town Hall on other business, and was asked to come over and say\na few words. He took the megaphone and, according to a press\nreport, which he accepted as being accurate, he said:-\n\"The reason Sir Kenneth Newman is threatening the use of rubber\nbullets is because on Sunday night the police got a bloody good\nhiding. The police will not accept that Black youths can successfully\norganise themselves and outsmart them and outmanoeuvre them.\"\nHe again repeated that he was not going to condemn the actions of\nthe youth on Sunday night.\n6.7 We questioned Councillor Grant closely about these statements.\nHe made a distinction between them. He regretted that he had made\nthe remark that the policeman may have been killed by another\npoliceman. He had been trying to make the point that the death was\nstill being investigated and one should not jump to conclusions. He\ntold us that it was \"a bit of ridiculous thing to say, in retrospect\".\nHe commented that he must have spoken half a million words during\nthat period, and the press had pulled out and concentrated on two or\nthree statements.\n126\n6.8 Councillor Grant did not withdraw his remarks about the police\ngetting a good hiding and being outmanoeuvred. He explained that he\nhad been putting forward the view not only of the young people, but\nof a substantial section of the community. We asked him whether he\nagreed with that view. He replied that factually the youths did\noutmanoeuvre the police. There then followed a question and answer\nsession which we think right to set out in full. Lord Gifford referred to\nCouncillor Grant's speech of the 14th October calling for\nreconciliation, and continued:-\nLord Gifford: \"Is it really consistent with a desire for reconciliation\nto make statements which, whether factually true or not, give the\nstrong impression of taking sides with the youth against the police\nand supporting them in a battle of two sides?\"\nCouncillor Grant: \"Well yes, I would think so, because I think we\nhave to understand that the young people are at the bottom of the\nsocial pile; that all the forces were ranged against them at the\nparticular period. I think that it's part of the job of a political\nleader to assess the situation and face various sections of the\ncommunity. If I had condemned the young people, as well as the\nwhole of the press, media, Government and so on, I think that\ntoday we would have the situation that has occurred in other places\nin the country, in Liverpool and in Handsworth. When Neil\nKinnock came to Broadwater Farm, he made one important\nobservation. He said he had been to other places after\ndisturbances, and on Broadwater Farm he found that the spirit of\nthe young people was very strong, that people weren't demoralised.\nIn all the other cases, in Handsworth and everywhere else, all the\npeople were demoralised. And I think that the reason that they\nwere not demoralised was that I did not come out and condemn\nthem like everybody wanted. So they felt Haringey and the rest of\nthe council and the Labour Party stood behind them in this\nparticular situation. They felt that they were not condemned totally\nby society. This tenuous thread that we set up between us and the\nyouths is now beginning to develop, and now we are able to wean\nthe youths away from acts of violence into political action. For\nexample, in the election they voted for the first time.\"\n6.9 We consider that this was a cogent answer which deserves.\ncareful attention. Councillor Grant was clearly aware on 7th October\nof the need to maintain a relationship between the Black community,\nparticularly the youths, and the established political structures which\n127",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nhe represented. He himself, it is clear, did not believe in the use of\nviolence against the police, and was shocked by both of the deaths\nwhich had occurred. But he understood the background of injustice,\nand had himself experienced, at the meeting at the Youth Association\non 6th October, the bitter rejection of many of those present of\nconventional political methods.\n6.10 Instead of avoiding the problem by distancing himself from\nBlack youths, he tried honestly to articulate their position. In doing so\nhe walked a tightrope, for as an elected leader he represented others\nalso. The words quoted above were not well chosen and should not\nhave been said. He knew as a political leader that the press would\nseize on an ill-considered phrase; and in this case they did, leading to\nthe impression that Councillor Grant revelled in the defeat of the\npolice. However, we are impressed with the honesty and courage\nwhich Councillor Grant showed in trying to articulate the grievances\nwhich had led to the disturbances, and in particular the death of Mrs\nJarrett, rather than evading the issue with bland statements.\n6.11 Councillor Grant gave his considered views to a special meeting\nof the council on 14th October 1985. He expressed his wholehearted\npersonal sympathy to the families of Mrs Jarrett and PC Blakelock.\nHe explained why he had spoken as he had, and accepted that \"some\nthings could have been better said\". He appealed to the police to\nshow respect for the young people of Haringey, and asked for a\nrethink of how Tottenham is policed. He said that the Labour group\nhad stepped back from withholding the police precept. He then\ncontinued:-\n\"Next I want to speak to the young people of Tottenham. I said\nearlier that I had spoken the truth last week about their situation\nthe and their attitudes. Now I want to speak my mind to them. I want\nto say that some things are wrong. Drug trafficking is wrong.\nThieving is wrong. Attacks on old people are wrong. Many of them\nHe have spent a lifetime fighting oppression also.\n\"And I want to say to the young people: violence offers no solution\nto your problems. You can't fight hatred with hatred. You can't\nfight fear with fear. You can't fight violence with violence. The\nstate's response will always escalate. Next time rubber bullets and\nHCS gas will be used. The time after that, the army will be brought\nin.\n\"The only way forward is through political action. I believe that the\n128\nпяс\nTHE AFTERMATH\nline I have taken over the last week has opened up at least the\npossibility of drawing young people into a dialogue about peaceful\npolitical solutions to your problems. If we could achieve that, it\nwould be a great step forward. So I appeal to you: step back from\nthe violence and allow the council to speak for you.\"\nThe whole of this speech was applauded by a large public from the\nBroadwater Farm community. The evidence which we have received\nindicates that they wished to heed Councillor Grant's words. The high\nvoting turnout - - 55% at the local election - also indicates a\nwillingness to use political channels. It may well be right that\nCouncillor Grant's actions helped to contribute to social unity and\nconstructive change.\n6.12 On Broadwater Farm in the week following the disturbances,\nthere was a real emergency. Postmen made no deliveries on the estate\non 7th October, 10th October, 11th October and 12th October. The\nreason recorded in the Post Office report was \"police advice\". Joanne\nGeorge was told by the Chief Postmaster that postmen did try to\ndeliver letters, but the police told them not to, because it would\nhamper their inquiries. Giro cheques, on which so many people\ndepended for their income, had been sent back to the Department of\nHealth and Social Security, leaving many people with no money at all.\nEmergency supplies of food were distributed twice during that week\n- first on Monday, to pensioners and other vulnerable people who\ncould not get to the shops outside the estate, and again on Friday\nbecause the Giro cheques had not arrived. The agencies which had\nbeen set up on the estate over the years proved their value - council\nstaff from the Neighbourhood Office worked with Youth Association\nworkers to cope with the needs and problems of many residents. This\ncollaboration provided essential supplies to people whose situation\nwould otherwise have been desperate.\n6.13 The physical damage and mess was cleared up with remarkable\nspeed. There were pavements to be repaired, burnt cars to be\nremoved, rubble and glass to be cleared away and the shops to be\nboarded up. But by the end of the second day, only the burnt scorch\nmarks on the roadway and smoke on the pillars of the blocks\nremained. The Broadwater Farm Junior and Infant schools were\nopened on 8th October, and the more damaged special schools by the\nfollowing Monday. The Head of the Junior School appreciating that\nchildren would have experienced the events and perhaps been\n129",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\ndisturbed by them, encouraged them to speak and write about them.\nHe told us:-\n\"In their writing they expressed fear and fright from the noise, the\nexplosions and the police, but some of them quite enjoyed the\nevent.\"\nThe owners of cars which had been destroyed were left without\ncompensation for their loss. Their claims under the Riot Damages Act\nwere refused; the Act provides compensation for damage to premises\nthrough riots, but was passed in 1886 before the age of the motor\nvehicle.\nTHE ARRESTS AND SEARCHES\n-\n-\n6.14 On Thursday 10th October came the first arrests by the squad\nof officers assigned to the murder investigations. By the end of\nNovember, there had been 141 arrests; by the end of May there had\nbeen 359. 18% of those arrested were juveniles, 9% were women.\nThe great majority lived on or\nor were closely connected with\nBroadwater Farm. 271 homes on the estate over a quarter of the\nwhole estate were searched by the police. In 18 cases the doors\nwere smashed in with sledgehammers and had to be replaced. By the\nend of May, 162 people had been charged with offences alleged to\nhave been committed on 6th October, including six charged with\nmurder and riot, seven with riot, 56 with affray and three with\nexplosives (petrol bomb) charges. According to government statistics\n71% of those arrested were Black, and 25% were White.\n6.15 It is important to set the legal context in which these arrests\nwere made. The police team had reason to believe that hundreds of\npeople had done acts which (subject to any legal defences) were\ncrimes under the law. They had taken a huge number of photographs\non the night. From 13th October they had been conducting house-to-\nhouse inquiries around the whole estate, recording a range of\ninformation from place of birth to knowledge of neighbours and of the\nnight's events. It would not have been surprising if they had identified\na number of people who could reasonably be suspected of having\ncommitted offences. If so, the law allowed them to arrest such people\nand search their homes. The law also allowed the police to question\nsuspects, subject to certain safeguards. If from legitimate questioning\nthey obtained information which led to reasonable suspicion of others,\nthey were entitled to arrest them also.\n130\nTHE AFTERMATH\n6.16 The investigation has undoubtedly caused and continues to\ncause great fear, suffering and outrage, particularly for those arrested\nand charged and their families. Is this the inevitable result of a\nlegitimate criminal investigation? Or have the police in carrying out\nthe investigation abused their legal powers? A representative of the\nBroadwater Farm Defence Campaign understood this key distinction\nwhen he said:-\n\"In a way it is accepted that they are going to be arrested for what\nhas happened, but I feel that in many cases they are not so much\nworried about being arrested, but about the way they are arrested.\"\n-\n6.17 In dealing with this issue the Inquiry faces certain limitations.\nNearly all the people who have been charged are still awaiting trial;\nthey and their solicitors have not been able to give evidence to us\nabout their cases. The justification of the investigating team for some\nof their actions - breaking doors, detention over days, refusing access\nto solicitors is not known, and may become clearer during the\ncoming trial. Even those who have been released without charge\ncontinue to be fearful, and few have given evidence to us. Many\npeople's experiences have been relayed at second hand by other\nwitnesses. Accordingly, in reviewing the evidence about the police\ninvestigation we have described the position at law (this itself is\ncomplex because the law changed on 1st January 1986); set out the\nallegations made in general terms; and raised certain questions. In\nmost cases we have not made definite findings. But the questions, and\nthe answers which must eventually be given at the end of the trial, are\nof central importance to the integrity of the police investigations.\n-\n6.18 On 1st January 1986 the main provisions of the Police and\nCriminal Evidence Act 1984 relating to police powers of arrest,\nsearch, detention and questioning, came into force. As well as the\nAct, there were Codes of Practice - in particular codes relating to\nthe searching of premises and the seizure of property, and to the\ndetention treatment and questioning of persons by police officers. We\nwill refer to the Act and the Codes of Practice as \"the new law\".\nBefore the new law came into force, there were a number of legal\ncontrols over police investigations, such as the Judges Rules; but in\ngeneral these controls (\"the old law\") were less clearly defined.\n6.19 A further complication was that in the period from July to\nDecember 1985, the police at Tottenham Police Station were\n131",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHE AFTERMATH\nconducting a \"trial run\" of the new Act. We understand this to mean,\nin theory at least, that police officers had been told to use the\nprocedures and safeguards of the new law as far as they were legally\nable to. Many have alleged to us that in practice, the extended police\npowers of the new law were operated, but its safeguards were not.\n6.20 The smashing down of the front door is the most horrific\nintrusion imaginable into the privacy of the home. It was done to 18\nhomes on Broadwater Farm, a shattering experience for the\noccupants, and a cause of great fear to many others. Joanne George\nsaid:-\n-\n\"You would go to bed and you would just lie there and you would\nthink are they going to come and kick my door, what's going to\nhappen to my children? Wherever you went that's all you heard\nam I next? If your friend's house got raided and arrested, are they\ncoming for me? It was that horrible fear that you lived with day by\nday, knowing that they could come and kick down your door and\ncome and drag you off and hold you for hours.\"\n6.21 The smashing of doors was carried out by a large squad\nincluding armed officers. Rupert Downing described a scene early one\nSunday morning, after he had slept overnight in a flat on the estate:-\n\"There was this huge noise and the whole block was rocking. I\nwent out of the front door of the flat to find out what was going on,\nto be confronted by an officer with a very large high-powered rifle\nstanding immediately outside the flat. He looked very surprised to\nsee this White geezer with a brief-case coming out of the flat. I\nwent downstairs to the precinct to find about 50 police officers\nhammering in the door of the Fruit and Veg Co-op.\"\nRupert Downing knew that the police had already searched the\nCo-op several times with the full co-operation of the workers. He\nasked the officers why they did not contact the Co-op, but got no\nanswer. He overheard a plain clothes officer say to another, \"We are\ngoing to have to be a bit more careful.\"\nthe Diverse Reports\n6.22 D.A.C. Richards, interviewed on the Diverse\nprogramme in October 1986, said:-\n\"Policemen would not force their way into flats if there were any\nother means of getting into the flat. We have to gain entry into the\npremises and because they are well fortified the only way we can\nget into the premises is by way of sledgehammers or fairly hefty\n132\nequipment. If we had the keys to get into the premises it would be\nvery much easier.\"\nLater in the same programme, D.A.C. Richards sought to justify\nthe methods used by reference to the scale of the crimes committed:-\n\"I wonder if we can get the Broadwater Farm in its true perspective\n- we are investigating a most horrific murder - a policeman\nstabbed to death. We witnessed at the Broadwater Farm the most\nferocious, the most vicious riots ever seen on the mainland. It is\ntherefore in the very nature of things if we are seeking murderers\nand gunmen, that on occasion, we will have to take what some\npeople will see as dramatic action, reactive measures.\"\n6.23 The statement that the premises were \"well fortified\" was\nmisleading. It suggested people making a barricade of their doors. In\nfact, as D.A.C. Richards must have known, the doors were\n\"fortified\" by the council, on the advice of crime prevention officers,\nas a protection against burglars. If there is any proper justification for\nthe smashing down of so many doors, it could only be in the context\nof the use of firearms during the disturbances. A reasonable belief\nthat the smashing down of a door was necessary to protect police\nofficers from being shot, would in theory justify such force. But in\nreality, how would the heavy and continuous smashing of a door\nprotect the lives of police officers? Would it not rather alert the\nalleged \"gunman\" to their presence outside his door? Did the\ninvestigating team who smashed these 18 doors consider seriously\nwhat outrage they were inflicting? Did they balance that against the\nsupposed risks to their officers? Or were they acting in this way simply\nto intimidate not just the occupants of the particular flats, but the\nestate as a whole?\n6.24 Vivid evidence was given to us about the arrival of the arresting\nteam on 17th October at the home of Mrs Scott, who lives in a house\nin Tottenham, (not on the estate):-\n\"While I was ironing I heard the gate open and two persons talk so\nI thought somebody was coming to the door and I look, I didn't see\nanybody. Then I saw something rush across the window and I saw\none pointing up. I went over and look and I saw one pointing to my\nbedroom, on at the gate with his hand on the trigger like this,\npointing straight to the front door, one next door pointing like this.\nI heard my daughter scream, the youngest one. She was partly\ndressed in the bathroom and there were three pointing the guns at\nher in the bathroom. And others surround the place.\"\n133",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHE\nTHE AFTERMATH\nMrs Scott said that there were seven officers who entered the house\nwith guns, and others over in the gardens behind her house. One of\nthe officers produced a piece of paper which he said was a warrant to\nsearch the house for firearms. Mrs Scott described what was taken\nfrom the house:-\n\"My husband was going to Jamaica and we went out shopping in\nFinefare. All my food has the stamp on it for Finefare and we\nbrought a lot of tinned meats and flour, sugar, rice and all\neverything possible to send home, and they took everything just the\nsame. And photographs. There were six in Roger's room. They\ntook all his complete clothes, his complete wardrobe. I remember\none count 17 pairs of jeans. They took suits, they took everything.\nThey broke my trunk, they took out things I bought before Millard\nwas born and you don't see those things now.\"\nMrs Scott said that some of the clothes had been returned but none\nof the food. She got no receipt for the goods which had been taken.\nShe herself has been visiting hospital for her nerves ever since. It\nshould be noted that none of her family were charged with any\noffence arising from 6th October; Stafford Scott was arrested on the\nsame day, held for 36 hours, and released without any charge.\n6.25 Bagfuls of personal possessions were removed from many\nhomes: including complete wardrobes of clothes, contents of food\ncupboards, or kitchen knives, television and stereo equipment,\npersonal diaries and photographs. People needed emergency\nassistance from Social Security because they were literally without\nanything to wear. A lot of property has now been returned, but some\nremains in police hands, even though the owner has not been charged.\nRequests from solicitors have often been met with the excuse that the\npolice are too busy. The law allows a police officer to seize and retain\nproperty if it is needed for evidence at a trial, or for forensic\nexamination, or if it may be stolen. We can understand that the\ninvestigating officers would justify the retention of knives and clothes\nfor traces of blood or matching with photographs. Taking food seems\nmore difficult to justify, since the supermarket was looted mainly for\nammunition, and labels could be checked on the spot without taking\neverything away. The questions which we have to ask are:- Was\nthere a real belief that the property taken might provide evidence of\nan offence, or was property taken on mere speculation? Were\npersonal papers and diaries taken because of their relevance to any\ncrime, or to enable the police to build up and record on computer a\n134\ngeneral network of intelligence about the residents of the estate, their\nhabits of life and their friends? Were the searches and seizures normal\nfor a serious inquiry, or were they also part of a process of\nintimidation?\nDETENTION AND QUESTIONING\n6.26 Those who were arrested were taken to one of a variety of\npolice stations (14 in all were used) and held incommunicado. The\none police station which was not used was Tottenham. Their relatives\nhad no idea where they were. Sheila Ramdin, chair of the new\nResidents' Association, describes their distress:-\n\"I have had mothers coming to me screaming, crying. They don't\nknow where their son is, someone has been picked up, they don't\nknow what police station. We tried to phone around to find out\nwhere their son is. They might say, well he's in Chingford, and then\nwe phone Chingford. Who told you he's at Chingford? It's not\nChingford. It must be somewhere else. We don't know where he is.\nWe haven't got him here.\"\nIn one case it took the workers at the day nursery a whole day to\nfind out where a mother was, whose child was at the nursery. Debbie\nWilde reported on the detention of a pregnant woman whose relatives\nwere kept waiting all day to see her, despite promises that access\nwould be given. There is no doubt that great suffering was caused\nthrough the mental anguish of not knowing where a relative was or\nwhat was happening to him or her.\n6.27 The new law provides that a person arrested and held in a\npolice station has the right to have one friend or relative told of the\narrest and where the person is detained. Delay in allowing this right is\nonly permitted when an officer of Superintendent rank has reasonable\ngrounds for believing that this will lead to interference with evidence,\nor the alerting of other people, or will hinder the recovery of\n.property. The old law gave a similar right, except that delay was\npermitted if it was necessary in the interests of the investigation or\nprevention of crime. What justification existed for the denial of the\nright in these cases? What evidence would have been interfered with,\nif relatives had been informed? What other people would have been\nalerted? How would the recovery of property have been hindered?\nWe find it difficult to believe that these questions can be answered.\nHowever serious the investigation, it is not acceptable for police\nofficers to hide suspects away in unknown places.\n135",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\n6.28 There was a uniform policy to forbid arrested people access to a\nsolicitor. The new law provides that an arrested person has in theory\nthe right to consult a solicitor privately at any time. But delay in\ngranting this right may only be authorised by a Superintendent if there\nare reasonable grounds for believing that exercising it will lead to\ninterference with evidence, or injury to other persons, or the alerting\nof other suspects, or will hinder the recovery of property. In any case,\nunder the new law, the right must be granted after 36 hours. Yet in\nthe months of 1985 when the new law was meant to be having a trial\nrun, the 36 hour rule was not respected. The right of access to a\nsolicitor under the old law was defined more loosely: a person had the\nright unless unreasonable delay or hindrance would be caused to the\nprocesses of investigation or the administration of justice. The Court\nof Appeal had clearly ruled that it was not permissable to deny the\nright because an investigating officer feared that a solicitor would\ninform the suspect of his or her rights. Yet in this investigation, the\npolicy of refusing access to a solicitor was maintained on many\noccasions even after people had appeared in court, when they were\nremanded in police custody for further questioning. It is hard to avoid\nthe conclusion that the investigating officers denied access to solicitors\nbecause they wished to hold suspects incommunicado for long periods\nand thus put maximum pressure upon them to make a confession.\n6.29 On a few occasions the investigating officers went as far as\nsaying that a suspect could not have access to his or her chosen\nsolicitor, but only to a solicitor chosen by the police. The investigating\nofficers claimed that there was \"a conflict of interest\" between that\nsuspect and other clients of the same solicitor. An attempt was made\nto get a High Court order to prevent this, but the judge said that he\nhad no jurisdiction to intervene. One of the solicitors involved,\nGabriel Black, described this action by the police as \"utterly\noutrageous\", and we agree. It is no business whatsoever of the police\nto decide whether a solicitor has a conflict of interests. Another\nsolicitor, Gwen Bart, said that the conduct of the police during this\ninvestigation was quite unlike anything that she had experienced\nbefore. We asked her in what way did she think that the police were\nabusing their legal powers:-\n\"Basically it's the attitude that they have had when they have\narrested people. When you ring the station they take a long time to\npo return calls, and sometimes they have not returned calls. They have\ndeclined to give a lot of information. They have interviewed some\n136\nTHE AFTERMATH\nof the suspects very late at night. I just feel as though they take it\npersonally, ie 'one of us is dead and you are going to pay for it'.\"\nGabriel Black was concerned that when her clients' rights had been\nabused, there was no form of accountability or channel for complaint.\nIn the past she had contacted Scotland Yard's Complaints Division,\nbut in this investigation \"it seemed that the whole way up the line was\njust a blank\".\n6.30 The time spent by suspects in detention and questioning at the\npolice stations was considerable. It was common for people to be\ndetained for two and three days without being charged. In the case of\nmany who were charged, the charge would be for a minor offence, but\nthe police would apply at the Magistrates Court for a remand into\npolice custody for three days, so that they could continue questioning\nthe defendant about \"more serious offences\". Andy Shallice, who was\nobserving in Tottenham Magistrates Court on a research project for\nthe Runnymede Trust, noted 30 such applications, of which 28 were\ngranted, out of 100 Broadwater Farm cases which he witnessed.\n6.31 Under the old law the police were obliged to bring an arrested\nperson before a magistrates court \"as soon as practicable\". What was\npracticable would vary according to the time of arrest and the time of\ncourt sittings. The view of lawyers was that the law allowed for\ndetention in a police station for 48 hours at the outside. Under the\nnew law, the maximum period of detention without charge is 96\nhours, but the police are obliged to obtain authorisation from a\nmagistrates court in a private hearing for any detention after 36 hours.\nThe power of the Magistrates Court to order a remand into police\ncustody for three days existed both under the old law and the new,\nalthough in practice it had normally been employed when a defendant\nwas willing to be detained in the police station; for example a\ndefendant who was giving information to the police about other\npeople. As noted above, the new law gives an absolute right of access\nto a solicitor after 36 hours, including during any period on remand in\npolice custody, whereas the right to see a solicitor under the old law\nwas much more vague.\n6.32 Accordingly the police, by detaining people in the police station\nfor up to three days in the first instance, were stretching their powers.\nunder the old law to the legal limit and beyond. By applying for\nremands into police custody, the police were obtaining legal authority\n137",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nТЯОЧНЯ УЯНОМ»\nTHE AFTERMATH\nfor a further three days of questioning. By refusing access to solicitors\nduring the whole of the questioning period, the police were taking\nadvantage of the looseness of the old law, and (although they were\nmeant to be carrying out a test run of the new Act) they were refusing\nto observe the provision of the new law which allows access as a right\nto a solicitor after 36 hours. Why were people being detained and\nquestioned for such long periods? Was it in order to obtain true and\nvoluntary information about serious criminal offences? Or was it to\nisolate and put pressure on vulnerable young people in order to obtain\n\"confessions\" from them? These are questions which are certain to be\nraised during the trial of particular defendants. We are only able to\nobserve in general terms that the longer a person is detained\nincommunicado and interrogated, the greater the danger that a false\nconfession will be made. That is the purpose of the safeguards in the\nnew law, and we are disturbed that they were not respected during the\ncourse of this investigation.\n6.33 The evidence relating to the treatment of juveniles was also\nmost disturbing. 23 juveniles (ie young people under 17) were brought\nbefore the courts on charges arising from the disturbances, and the\nmajority of these are still awaiting trial. Other juveniles were arrested\nand released without charge. Michael Hutchinson-Reis, one of the\nBroadwater Farm social work team and an experienced social worker,\ndescribed the situation as he saw it:-\n\"A large part of our work after 6th October was actually tracking\ndown where juveniles were being kept. It is a significant change in\nprocedures that juveniles were being held for such long periods,\nquite often released without charge, and in many instances held\nincommunicado, when families, relatives, solicitors and social\nworkers spent a lot of time actually trying to locate them.\"\nThe policy of refusing access to solicitors was applied also to\njuveniles. Michael Hutchinson-Reis described the problems which he\nfaced in trying to help a juvenile who had admitted to having stolen\nthree Mars bars on the night of 6th October:-\n\"That juvenile was questioned not so much about what he had\nstolen, which he admitted, but about his circumstances, his\nwhereabouts, who he was with, what happened, for about three\nhours. Eventually at 9 o'clock on a Friday evening he was kept in\nthe station. I made representations to the police about contact with\nrelatives, solicitors and so on, and basically I was eased out of the\npolice station in a way I have not usually had the experience of.\"\n138\n6.34 The written submission to us from the council's Social Services\nDepartment discloses other instances which give rise to intense\nconcern as to whether the rights of juveniles were respected. It\nrecords that in some cases adults who were total strangers were\nbrought in to witness interviews in police stations (since by law a\n\"responsible adult\" must be present when a juvenile is interviewed).\nIt records that one boy was observed to appear in court wearing paper\nclothes, another barefoot, another wearing a pair of enormous men's\ntrousers and large shirt, others looking tired, pale and unkempt.\n6.35 Solicitor Gabriel Black told us of one case which she was free\nto talk about because no charges were pending against the boy\nconcerned. The case was of a 15-year-old boy arrested as a suspect for\nmurder and held in the police station for two-and-a-half days. The old\nlaw required that if a juvenile had to be detained overnight,\narrangements had to be made with Social Services for him or her to be\nkept in their care. But in this case, the boy spent two nights in a\nlocked police cell. His mother had been present during interviews\nwith him and had found them oppressive and very threatening. She\nhad asked the police for Ms Black to be present but they had refused.\nHe was finally released at a police station miles away from Tottenham\nwithout any shoes on. We find it quite unacceptable for a young boy\nto be treated in that way.\n-\n6.36 Many allegations were made to us about the conditions of\ndetention and the manner of questioning. Some concerned particular\ncases of actual maltreatment deprivation of sleep, assaults and\nextreme threats. We cannot make findings about these allegations,\nsince in most cases the alleged victims are awaiting trial and we did\nnot hear directly from them. There was other evidence, some of it\nfirst hand, about the general pattern of questioning. People who were\narrested were told that they were known to be involved in a serious\n.crime the murder or the rioting. The questioning went on and on. If\npeople denied being involved, they were told that they must have seen\nwho was involved, and names of particular suspects were put to them.\nIf they claimed not to have seen anyone, they were asked about who\nwas likely to have been involved. Panchita La Touche, Deputy Senior\nPlayworker at the Broadwater Farm Play Scheme, described the\nexperience as she saw it:-\n-\n\"They said they had got strong evidence that I was out there. But I\nknew I was not out there. I just let them carry on with their games.\n139",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHE AFTERMATH\nThey were getting on my nerves, they were annoying me by telling\nme I was doing something and I knew I wasn't. Trying to get me to\ntell lies. The next morning they said they had strong evidence that I\nreceived bloodstained clothes from a suspect. I said no, that's not\ntrue, that's a lie. They said but you know that's the truth, just tell\nus that. They got on my nerves until they saw that there was\nnothing that they could do. To get me to tell a lie like that, that's\nwhat they wanted. Because they were trying to brainwash me, they\nwere trying to get me to believe it. For me just to give up and say,\nwell, oh yeah, it does go like that.\"\n6.37 We have to consider this evidence against the background of a\nserious murder investigation. It is lawful for police officers, if they\nhave genuine grounds for suspecting people, to arrest and question\nthem, putting their suspicions to them and pressing for an answer. But\nit is not lawful for the police to arrest people \"on spec\", without any\ngenuine grounds for suspicion, and then try to induce them to\nimplicate themselves or other people. And it is not lawful for the\npolice to use such intense methods, to isolate people for so long, to\nput such pressure on them that they are confused and, in desperation,\nadmit to things which they have not done.\n6.38 Had the police genuine reason to suspect those whom they\narrested? Or have they been fishing for information, using conditions,\nisolation and the fear generated by an accusation of murder to extract\nunwilling and unreliable answers? Panchita La Touche was clearly a\nperson who was able to defend her innocence. Others were more\nvulnerable. The story of Howard Kerr, reported in the Daily Mirror\non 20th March 1986, reveals the danger. He was a youth of 17 who\nwas detained for two and a half days. He was not allowed to see a\nlawyer or relative. He at first claimed that he was in Windsor on the\nnight of 6th October. Later he made a 50 page \"confession\" to taking\npart in the riots, naming 20 other \"participants\", describing a\n\"factory\" of petrol bombs, and claiming to have seen the murder of\nthe police officer. But later it was established from independent\nevidence that he was indeed in Windsor that evening, and the\nprosecution dropped all charges against him. Outside court he said:-\n\"I was frightened, so I told them what I thought they wanted to\nknow.\"\nFrom all the circumstances of the investigation, we fear that there\n140\nmust be many other young people who were so frightened that they\nsimilarly told the police what they thought they wanted to know.\n6.39 Andy Shallice, researcher for the Runnymede Trust, gave\nevidence about the handling of the Broadwater Farm cases in the\nMagistrates Court. He said that there was a team of officers who\npresented the Broadwater Farm cases, who objected to bail in 95% of\nthe cases. The most frequent reasons which they gave were that the\ndefendant might commit further offences, or that defendants might be\nthreatened and therefore should be kept in custody for their personal\nsafety. He was concerned that in a number of cases the defence\nlawyers did not put much energy or effort into pressing for bail. He\nsaid that when a Broadwater Farm defendant appeared, it was\napparent that the police \"took over the cases and the organisation of\nthe court room\", particularly by arranging for a number of plain\nclothes officers to be standing around the court. We are unable to\nmake comment upon individual decisions of the court, but we are\nconcerned that there was not seen to be, in Andy Shallice's words, \"a\npassive and equal atmosphere between defence and prosecution\".\n6.40 Andy Shallice gave us some particular information about the\ntreatment of juveniles. He said:-\n\"In the first week after 6th October, four juveniles appeared in\ncourt, in the adult court at Tottenham. No reference was made by\nthe Magistrates about the fact that now a juvenile court was\nessentially sitting. All those juveniles were charged on their own;\nthey weren't charged with adult defendants over the age of 17. The\npublic gallery wasn't cleared, the press were allowed to sit. In\nanother five cases over the next weeks into the end of November, a\ntotal of nine juveniles appeared at Tottenham Court during the\nadult hearings and the public gallery wasn't cleared, and there was\nno attempt to reconvene the session into a juvenile court for that\none hearing.\"\nThe law provides that no charge against a juvenile may be heard in\nan adult court, unless the juvenile is charged jointly with an adult. A\njuvenile court is not even permitted to sit in a court room which has\nbeen or will be used as an adult court within an hour before or after\nthe sitting of the juvenile court. When a juvenile court is sitting,\nmembers of the public may not be present unless specially authorised\nby the court; the press may be present, but may not report the case in\nany way which might reveal the name or address of the juvenile. We\n141",

He was certain that there were not.\nWe are most concerned about the rights of juveniles which appear not\nto have been respected by the court.\nBROADWATER FARM SINCE OCTOBER 1985\n6.41 For three months a massive police presence remained on the\nestate. The Police Research Unit observed that every day around the\nestate there was a van filled with riot equipment; a mobile command\ncentre; a mobile incident room; a tea van and mobile toilets; and a\nnumber of transit vans full of police. On 1st November their staff\ncounted nine police support units at the entrances to the estate; On\n6th November eight; On 13th November seven; And on 18th\nNovember thirteen. Every day there was a heavy deployment of\nuniformed officers patrolling the estate, especially on Tangmere,\nwhere they stood about the precinct and the many balconies over\nlooking it. Reverend John Wheaton, Minister of the Miller Memorial\nMethodist Church, on the corner of The Avenue and Mount Pleasant\nRoad, described the police presence at this time:-\n\"In the few weeks after the riot the police were in Mount Pleasant\nRoad with their coaches, vans and real heavy force. It got\noppressive after a while; you couldn't move without seeing a\npoliceman in riot gear. One of their nasty habits, they have stopped\nit now, was when they parked their vans in Willan Road, Adams.\nRoad and Gloucester Road. One of the first things they would do\n- this went on for over a month after the riot had finished\ntake their riot shields out and line them up against the wall, which I\nfound rather provocative.\"\n-\nwas to\nHe described also what happened when he visited the family of one\nof the youths charged with murder: -\n\"Immediately I approached the front door about four policemen\nwould just appear from around the corner, and when I went out\nthey would still be there. Very polite, but you know you were being\nkept an eye on.\"\n6.42 There was a decrease in the numbers after Christmas, and a\nfurther decrease after defendants on the murder charge had been.\ncommitted for trial. The mobile command centre and other vehicles\nwere removed; but there remained a level of patrolling which was far\nin excess of anything normally seen on an estate or in a residential\n142\narea. To this day, it is most unusual to make even a short visit to the\nestate without seeing two officers walking around, and a van full of\nofficers is normally waiting in The Avenue near the Gloucester Road\nentrance. Lord Gifford asked a parliamentary question to attempt to\ndiscover the precise numbers involved. He asked: -\n\"What was the level of police manpower deployed on patrolling\nduties on and around the Broadwater Farm Estate, Tottenham,\nbetween 7th October 1985 and 27th March 1986?\"\nThe answer which came back from Lord Glenarthur, Minister of\nState at the Home Office, was singularly uninformative:-\n\"I understand from the Commissioner that the level of police\nmanpower deployed on the Broadwater Farm varied during the\nperiod in question according to operational demand. On 27th\nMarch, 15 officers were deployed on the estate at any one time\nthrough the 24 hour period.\"\nThe one figure given in this answer is significant. 15 officers\ndeployed \"at any one time\" on an estate of 1,000 dwellings, nearly six\nmonths after the disturbances, represents a hugely expensive use of\npolice resources. We record below, that we were informed that for\nevery unit of officers on a shift, half will be on patrolling duty at any\none time. Allowing for three shifts, the Minister's answer would\nindicate that up to 90 police officers were assigned to the estate every\nday.\n6.43 The report of the Metropolitan Police Commissioner for 1985\nincludes a table headed \"Public Order events which required the\nemployment of more than 1,000 officers\". We have studied it with\ncare. There are the following entries which clearly relate to the\npolicing of Broadwater Farm and the surrounding area:-\nNumber of police\n7th Oct Aid requirements - central London reserve 1,409\n8 & 9 Oct\n10-14 Oct\n15-18 Oct\n19 & 20 Oct\n21-27 Oct\n3,732\n9,165\nAid to 'Y' District (Tottenham)\n3,044\n1,522\n3,213\n3,744\n3.744\n3,104\n143\n28 Oct-4 Nov\n5-11 Nov\n12-18 Nov",

There are only 12 other entries in\nthis table for the whole of 1985 - major demonstrations, State visits\nand the London Marathon which have entries of between 1,000 and\n2,000 officers, and the Notting Hill Carnival which has an entry of\n7,259 officers. They show that in addition to the numbers of police\nobserved on and around the estate, there were hundreds more, even\nthousands, held in reserve. In the period between 10th and 14th\nOctober when the first arrests were made, the number rose to an\namazing 9,165. There are no entries which refer to the Brixton\ndisturbances - apart from the Cherry Groce Support Campaign\ndemonstration on 11th November (1,405 officers). The huge numbers\nof police assigned to Y District appear to us to be a measure of the\nserious over-reaction to the 6th October disturbances which continued\nfor an excessive time.\n6.44 The Richards report stated that high profile uniformed policing\nwas necessary \"to maintain the Queen's peace, reduce the fear of\ncrime and enhance the quality of life for the residents\". He listed four\nfurther considerations:-\n(1) To afford protection to the patrolling uniformed officers.\n(2) To give support to residents who have made statements to the\npolice and felt under threat.\n(3) To respond to the call of many who have articulated their need\nfor a heavy police presence.\n(4) To give support to C.I.D officers who are executing search\nwarrants and making arrests.\n6.45 On 5th November 1985, the Chief Executive wrote to D.A.C.\nRichards stating that the numbers of police officers on the estate and\nparticularly on Tangmere were seen as \"stressful and oppressive\",\nand, as owners of the estate, asked the police to leave. Commander\nRichards replied that he would reduce the police presence \"when I am\nsatisfied that the likelihood of further breaches of the peace has\nreceded\". He reiterated his request for a police room to be allocated\non the estate. There was further correspondence, and the council said\nthat they were seriously considering instituting legal proceedings.\n144\nFinally, in what was discribed by Roy Limb as a \"very responsible\nact\", council members decided that to fight a legal battle with the\npolice would be a bad move, which the community would not like to\nsee, and that they should use every endeavour to secure a reduction to\nnormal levels of policing without going to court.\n6.46 The most recent public statement about the level of policing\nwas made by Chief Superintendent Alan Stainsby, who took over as\nsenior officer of the Tottenham Division in April 1986. Speaking to a\nmeeting of the Community and Police Consultative Group on 15th\nMay 1986, he said that at present there were 60 officers a day assigned\nto the estate, mostly from outside the division. There were three shifts.\nof 20, of whom ten were on duty at any one time. They were not\nalways patrolling, but often stayed in their transit vans keeping a\nwatch out. He said there was no desire to intimidate residents. He\nsaid that he was taking steps to phase out the assistance from outside\nthe division, and instead to set up a team of 16 Tottenham officers in\ntwo shifts from 8 a.m to 12 midnight, eight officers per shift. He\nhoped that after August this team would have taken over from the\noutside police officers, and at present the prospects looked good.\nHowever if there were further grounds for tension, the levels would\nhave to be increased again. He recognised that this was \"an extremely\nexpensive form of policing\", and hoped that in due course the team\ncould be reduced to below 16 officers. He was asked directly about\nthe idea of a mini-police station, and replied:-\n\"I can police Broadwater Farm with eight officers without a section\nhouse on the estate.\"\n6.47 There were some people who were reassured by the large\nnumbers of police in the early months, but many who found them\nintimidating and oppressive. Michael Hutchinson-Reis described it\nas:-\n\"A style and a school of policing that has more in common with the\noccupation of a foreign country by a colonising power.\"\nOur own view is that the numbers of police officers on the estate in\nthe months following 6th October were grossly excessive and did have\nthe effect of intimidating many residents. We can fully understand the\nneed to deploy large numbers of police officers in support of those\nwho were making arrests or carrying out searches on particular\noccasions. But it was not necessary to cover the estate around the\nclock with police officers who were doing nothing except stand about\n145",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTHE AFTERMATH\nor patrol. The position in law is that if a group of ordinary citizens had\ndone what the police were doing, they would have been guilty of a\nnuisance to the residents on the estate, and in addition (after the\ncouncil had asked them to leave) of a trespass. Police officers are only\nentitled to interfere with people's rights in such a way where there is a\nreal and imminent possibility of a breach of the peace. In such cases\nthey may take reasonable preventative measures. There have been no\nattacks on the police on Broadwater Farm since 6th October. We\nknow of no evidence that further disturbances were likely, and we\nthink that the measures taken far exceeded what was reasonable.\n6.48 The position today is considerably better, and witnesses who\nhad found the previous numbers of police officers most oppressive,\nfound the present levels bearable. Our survey which was carried out\nafter the significant reductions in the number of police, found that\n35% of residents considered that the present levels were too high,\n15% that they were too low, and 50% that they were about right. We\nreturn to this question of levels of policing in Chapter 8.\n6.49 As well as their numbers, the actions and attitudes of officers\non the estate have offended many people. Community worker Rupert\nDowning tried to intervene after a man had been arrested and a\nsenior officer was shouting at the crowd who had gathered. He\ndescribed the reaction of the officer when he pleaded with him to\ncalm the situation:-\n\"He didn't quite physically attack me but he looked as though he\nwanted to, and he said something like 'you council worker bastards,\nyou're responsible for the riot in the first place - you'd better\nwatch it. We can nick you as well.\"\n6.50 Many people fear that police officers patrolling the estate are\naffected by feelings of hatred and revenge towards Black people\nbecause of the death of PC Blakelock. The Middlesex Area Probation\nService considered that this fear was justified. In their submission to\nus they wrote:-\n\"During the days following the disturbances certain numbers of our\nstaff came into contact with several policemen and heard them\ntalking of revenge and 'sorting out' the people on the estate. There\nis a real fear in the area, which is made worse by rumour and\nspeculation, that a minority of police officers might exceed their\n146\nauthority and take advantage of any future disorder to satisfy their\nsense of grievance.\"\nBut there was evidence that some police officers were not prepared\nto be swayed by the reputation of the estate. Russell Simper, the\nEstate Supervisor, told us of words which he had heard spoken by an\nofficer from outside the Tottenham area: -\n\"Well, I've got a different attitude towards the Farm to what I had\nwhen I first came. I expected to come and see a load of rogues,\nvillains and vagabonds, but I find the majority of the people on this\nestate very nice people.\"\n6.51 Hugh Sutherland, who is employed as a carpenter in the\ncouncil's repairs unit on the estate, experienced provocation and racist\nabuse in a particularly ugly way, culminating in an arrest and charge.\nPolice officers after the disturbances would follow him and his\ngirlfriend, making monkey noises and making remarks like “climbed\nany good trees lately?\". His Ford Capri car was frequently covered\nwith stickers saying \"I love the Met\". He would partly peel them off\nand dispose of them. After some weeks of this, he was peeling off\nthese stickers in the presence of a number of officers who were saying\n\"What's the matter? Don't you love the Met then?\". As he peeled\nstickers off the back window, he found that others had been stuck on\nthe windscreen. He swore at the police and said that he would report\nthem. On 16th December, a few days later, he was about his business\non the estate when six or seven police officers came running towards\nhim. They grabbed hold of him by the arms. One of them hit him in\nthe face saying \"Well Mr Fucking Mouthy Orange Capri, we've got\nyou now, you cunt!\" He was bundled into a police van, forced to lie\ndown in the van, where officers kicked him and rested their feet on\nhim. He had a badly cut and swollen face and bruised ribs for some\nweeks afterwards. He was charged with abusive behaviour, but the\ncase was dismissed by the Magistrates Court. The case aroused\nconsiderable anger among Hugh Sutherland's fellow workers.\nTrade Unions organised a demonstration at the court and a one day\nstrike, in which about 300 employees took part.\n6.52 Having so many police officers on the estate and on call also\nleads to the danger of trivial incidents leading to large-scale\nconfrontation. Michael Hutchinson-Reis was surrounded by five or six\npolice officers when he went to collect a briefcase out of a colleague's\ncar. Sheila Ramdin described an incident at the end of May, the day\n147",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nbefore she gave evidence, when she had seen two boys having a\ndisagreement, and two patrolling officers went to see what was\nhappening:-\n\"I just heard one of the police say 'do you need assistance?' and\nbefore you knew it there was about three vans downstairs, and 20\nof them just came running upstairs, just standing there to see what\nwas going on\".\n6.53 However, not everyone who acted cheekily was the object of\nsuch attention from the police. Ernie Large tested out his theory that\nit was Black people who were the targets of attention, on a day in\nOctober, when there were masses of police on the estate:-\n\"I drove round the estate a number of times minus a tax disc. I\ntook out the tax disc and put a photo of my cat in place of it. I\ndrove round there with the police in their dozens looking over the\nbalcony, patrolling along the side. I also experimented by going in\nat Willan Road and coming out at Gloucester Road - backwards.\nA number of times. With all those attendant police, although I was\nlooked at, I was never stopped once.\"\n6.54 The events of 6th October and the subsequent police action\nhave had deep and painful affects on the people of Broadwater Farm.\nSocial worker Michael Hutchinson-Reis summed up the situation in\nthese terms:-\n\"In general terms the situation that many people are living in is so\nextreme and severe that the overall effect is to make people feel\nintimidated, fearful and very frightened. Certainly I myself have\nexperienced the feeling that even though I am a social worker\ncarrying an I.D card, I'm liable to arrest and detention and my\nfamily and friends won't know where I am. The realisation that that\ncould happen to you at any moment is quite frightening.\"\nHe spoke about a young man who had committed suicide in April\n1986 as being \"a casualty of the situation in which Black communities\nand the people of Broadwater Farm in particular have to live.\" Mary\nJohn Baptiste, representing the Defence Campaign spoke of one woman\nwho had developed a form of agoraphobia; she will not leave her\nhouse since the police raided it, and is terrified of her children leaving\nthe house. Sheila Ramdin told us that the Mothers' Project were\ntrying to form a family support group in order to provide support and\ncounselling to both adults and children who had been psychologically\naffected.\nTHE AFTERMATH\n6.55 We have heard disturbing stories about the effect of the police\nactions upon children. Community worker Joanne George, who has\nchildren aged four and five, said:-\n\"My children now believe that the police are going to get me. They\nsay to me 'Oh mummy, don't let the police get you'. If they see a\npoliceman they will want to run up and fight him - which is\nunbelievable. My child actually kicked a policeman in Tangmere\n-\nI was horrified, I had to run up and go and rescue my child.\"\nSheila Ramdin spoke of walking with a friend when two police\nofficers came towards them. She described the reaction of her friends'\nfour year old boy:-\n\"The boy was on the floor, he was just screaming, saying 'no\nMummy I can see police'. He was really shaking. I had never seen\nanything like it.\"\nShe spoke also of her own child aged four, who was shaking with\nfear when there was a blackout on the estate and a fire engine came.\nHe was crying \"Mummy what's happening? Are they going to fight\nagain?\" Michael Hutchinson-Reis spoke of a child suffering an\nanxiety attack on 5th November, when fireworks and bonfires caused\nhim to cling to his mother and scream with fear. Not everyone agreed\nthat there had been psychological damage to children; Ronny Roach,\nsenior worker at the play centre felt the children had not seen the\nriots as a real situation. But we remain very worried about the\nevidence on this point which we have heard.\n6.56 After 6th October there was a rush of tenants asking for\ntransfer requests. Many who were already on the transfer list came\ninto the Neighbourhood Office, and about 90 to 100 new tenants\nmade applications for transfers. The pressure eased off rapidly after\nthe first two or three weeks. Some of those requesting transfers had\nclearly been urged to do so by younger relatives who were worried\nabout their welfare. The Neighbourhood Officer, Neale Coleman said\nthat a lot of people still did want to move, and had done before the\ndisturbances: but the intense pressure on his office levelled off much\nmore quickly than he had anticipated. We deal in the next chapter\nwith the views that people have expressed about living on the estate.\n6.57 In the minds of people outside the estate it carries an even\nmore undesirable label than before. The experience of one woman\nwhom we interviewed was :-\n148\n149",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\n\"Even when I go for a job, and they say where do you live, and I\nsay Broadwater Farm, they look at you totally different.\"\nMany other witnesses spoke of similar experiences when they told\npeople where they lived. The post box in Gloucester Road was sealed\nup after 6th October and remains so to the present date. It has become\nmore difficult than ever to obtain credit. Mail order firms, TV hire\ncompanies, and companies trading on hire purchase are reluctant to\ndeal with people on the estate and in many cases have refused\noutright. Deposits of £100 are demanded for the connection of\nelectricity or gas. Pat Ford complained to the Consumer Protection\nService after Visionhire refused to offer slot TV rentals after the\ndisturbances. The answer given by the company to the Consumer\nProtection Officer was:-\n\"It was considered unreasonable to ask our teleclub meter\ncollectors to make calls on the estate as this could well lead to\npossible injuries to our staff who were known to be carrying\nreasonable large sums of money.\"\n-\n6.58 The community spirit, so bouyant in summer 1985, was far\nmore subdued as the summer of 1986 began. The numbers taking part\nin community activities had gone down particularly those such as\nthe Mothers' Project which drew in people from outside the estate.\nOne woman said to us that the community feeling was gone - it used\nto be \"alive and happy with the music, but now it's so quiet\". Cliff\nFord felt that the atmosphere was \"just beginning to come somewhere\naround normal, where you can see children playing around again, but\nit's only recently that that started to happen.\" Panchita La Touche felt\nthat people trusted each other much less than before. Several people\ninvolved with the Youth Association spoke of a sense of despair about\nthe future. Even so, they were continuing the day-to-day work of\nmaintaining and extending services to their community. The old\npeople never stopped coming to the Youth Association for their\nmeals. The projects created over the last five years still continue.

            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nWHO LIVES ON BROADWATER FARM- WHAT DO THEY THINK?\nmost favourably with other surveys of London in recent years. We\nbelieve that this results from three major factors -\nfirstly the sample\nwas drawn from a full enumeration of inhabited flats and houses on\nthe estates. Rather than rely on the electoral register (which itself was\nbeing constructed at the time of the disturbances and would therefore\nalmost certainly undercount) the research team carried out their own\nenumeration of the estate. This ensured that the sample was drawn\nfrom the full and real membership on the estate. Secondly, as much as\npossible, the interviewers were matched in gender and race to be\ninterviewed. Thirdly, each of the interviewers had an identity card\nissued by the Inquiry Panel which guaranteed both their bona fide\nstatus and ensured the confidentiality of the replies.\n-\n7.4 We did not ask about the residents' experience of the\ndisturbances. We do not believe that the survey method could provide\nsuch information. The survey does however settle a number of\nquestions about what people on the estate think. Both the police and\ncommunity leaders have made claims to be representing the estate\ndoing what \"the community\" want. Whilst it is clear that, as with any\nother locality, we can never talk of a unanimous opinion about\nanything and it will always be possible for mischief-makers to find one\nor two people who will provide opinions that are those of only a small\nminority on any issue, we can say with some certainty and some\naccuracy what the majority of people think about a broad range of\nissues. That is why we can say in a way that no other organisations\ncan, that these statistics represent, democratically, those who live on\nthe Broadwater Farm Estate and what they think. In this Chapter of\nour report we cover only the most salient facts. We have asked\nMiddlesex Polytechnic to provide a full report to Haringey Council\nlater in 1986.\nWHO LIVES THERE?\n7.5 We wanted to know how long people had lived on the estate\nspecifically to try and understand the extent of turnover and change.\nWe stress that this will not tell us the change over in tenancies, since\nsome individuals may have moved from one flat to another. We do\nhowever obtain a picture of the amount of movement.\nHow long have you lived on the estate? (all figures are percentages)\nunder 1 year\n17\n1-5\n40\n140\n152\nOVER 5 years\n43\nThere is some evidence of movement off the estate immediately\nafter the disturbances so there may be some little over-exaggeration of\nnew movement in these figures.\n7.6 This means that over half the adults on the estate have moved\nsince 1981. We chose that year because, as we explained in Chapter 3,\nit was in that year that the estate began to develop in a better\ndirection. It is also important to note that 17% of the adult population\nhas been there for less than a year - a fact that has important\nimplications for the community workers and organisations on the\nestate. Creating and recreating a community with this amount of\nchange is a much harder task - needing constant back-up and\ncommunication between new tenants and community organisations.\nPerhaps new residents need to be visited and introduced to the\ncommunity organisations on a regular basis to ensure that they are in\ntouch, not only with the council's services but also with the\ncommunity as a whole.\n7.7 We asked a series of questions about the general characteristics\nof our adult respondents. This is important since we have already\nreported that we know that over 50% of the adults on the estate have\nmoved onto the estate since 1981. This must mean that all of the\nCensus material from 1981 would be of little use in terms of\nrepresenting the population in 1986.\nThe Inquiry has heard a wide variety of different figures describing\nthe ethnic mix of the estate. At different times we have heard it\ndescribed as three-quarters or two-thirds Black. The Middlesex\nPolytechnic team decided to ask their interviewers to categorise the\nrace of the respondents. We reviewed the following figures that we\nbelieve are representative of the adult population of the estate.\nWhite\n49\nBlack (West Indian/African)\nIndian sub-continent\n42\n3\n6\nOther (e.g. Cypriot)\nWe must remember that this represents a sample of the adult\npopulation and in no way counts the children on the estate. We can\nguess at this by looking at the ethnicity of different age groups and\nroughly extrapolating the children under 16 from those figures.so\n153",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nWHO LIVES ON BROADWATER FARM- WHAT DO THEY THINK?\n7.8 Given the age differential we can compute that more than half of\nthe children on the estate are Black (West Indian/African) - raising\nthe overall ratio of the population to about half Black (West Indian/\nAfrican) and half White. These figures are important since there have\nbeen a broad range of different estimates put forward as fact to us\nabout the different proportions of Black people and White people -\non many occasions the number of Black people has been exaggerated.\n7.9 We asked the age of our respondents and again given the sample\nsize feel confident that this will reflect the age of the adults on the\nestate.\n% of the adult population\n16-24\n33\n25-44\n47\n45 plus\n20\nnationth\nThis population is different from the sound average in so far as\nthere are fewer older people.

These have an ethnic breakdown of:-\nWhite\nBlack (West Indian/African)\nOthers\n7.11 YEARLY HOUSEHOLD INCOME\n% of single parent\nfamilies\n32\n64\n4\nWe asked about the average household income on the estate. For us\nto compute people's incomes in detail we would have had to\nconcentrate upon a very wide range of questions about their assets\n154\nand expenditure. Since we wanted to look at a much wider range of\nopinions and attitudes we only asked one question about income:\nWhat is your average income in this household? If the answers were at\nall near the average it would not have been possible to draw any\nimportant conclusions. However, this was not the case. From the\nfollowing answers we can quite clearly say that the estate is poor.\nYEARLY HOUSEHOLD INCOME\nUnder £3,000\n£3,000 £7,999\n£8,000 £11,000\n-\n£12,000 £14,999\nOver £15,000\n35\n38\n722\nNo answer - 16\n7.12 Comparisons around income are not easy to make. We must\npoint out that given these overall income figures the economy of the\nestate is at a very low point indeed. This must affect the possibility of\nthe estate generating its own economic salvation. As a consequence if\nthis regeneration is to occur there must be some significant outside\ninput of resources.\n7.13 EMPLOYMENT\nWe asked whether the respondent was in employment; whether\nsomeone else in their household was and whether there were two or\nmore people in employment in that household. The answers were as\nfollows:-\nIn employment\nSomeone else in their household in employment\nTwo other people in employment\n31%\n15%\n2%\nIf we turn these percentages into actual numbers in employment\n(given 1063 households on the estate we can multiply by 10.5) we can\ncompute that there are 330 respondents in jobs, 160 live in households\nwhere someone else is in work, and there are about 30 other people in\nemployment. This means that, taking the estate as a whole, there are\nsome 500 530 people in full time employment. With an adult\npopulation of some 1800 this is a very low figure for economic\nactivity.\n-\n155",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nWHO LIVES ON BROADWATER FARM- WHAT DO THEY THINK?\nVOTING PATTERNS\n7.14 We asked for the voting intentions of people on the estate. The\nmonths of April/May 1986 saw quite bitterly fought local election\ncampaigns. Some Conservative councillors had called for the \"blowing\nup\" of the estate. As a consequence these statistics will reflect this\npolitical consciousness.\n% voting for different parties as a percentage of those who declared\na preference.\nLabour\nConservative\nAlliance\nOther\n77\n9\n8\n6\nThese statistics represent a great deal of support for one particular\nparty. If we also recognise that some 50% of registered voters voted\nin May 1986 then it is likely that the Labour Party received\nconsiderable votes from the estate.\n7.15 \"Monolithic\" and \"faceless\" are two of the ways in which the\nestate has been described and these are words which carry with them\npictures of isolation and fear. Consequently it was important for us to\nfind out if residents knew other people on the estate.\nHow many of your neighbours do you know?\nMost\n28\nA few\n51\nNone\n21\n-\nSocial isolation is not great here. It is unfortunately the case in most\nof Britain's cities that a section of the population is isolated. If we\nwere to ask the same question in any inner city area council estate,\nterrace houses or semi-detached suburban, it is likely that the number\nwould be the same or even greater. It is significant that over three-\nquarters of the population feel they know a few people, with a quarter\nwho would claim \"most\". This shows that a large number of people\nhave some social contact and nearly a quarter could be said to be fully\nintegrated into the community. If these figures are at all abnormal\nthey err on the side of integration and not isolation. Indeed, as will be\nseen later on (7.20), when we asked people about what they thought\nabout problems on the estate, 53% thought unfriendliness was no\nproblem at all.\n156\nCOMMUNITY ORGANISATION\n-\n7.16 We not only wanted to understand the extent to which people\non the estate knew each other we thought it was important to gauge\nthe success or failure of the community organisations on the estate. In\nChapter 3 we demonstrate the way in which these community\norganisations, and the Youth Association in particular, played a role\nin the regeneration of the estate. We feel it did this through a great\ndeal of imaginative hard work. It is important, though, to gauge the\nextent to which it has the overall support of the estate. Consequently\nwe asked a series of questions about the community organisations. We\nwanted to know whether people had heard of the organisation,\nwhether they had been to a meeting in the last two months, whether\nthey were members and what they thought of the quality of the\nservice.\nWe specifically asked about the six organisations that existed on the\nestate.\nQuality of\nservice\n(of those who\nhad heard of)\nHeard of\nBeen to\nmeeting\nMember\n% of All respondents\nYES\nYES YES\nYES\nGOOD\nBroadwater Farm\nYouth Association\n78\n7\n5\n81\nMothers' Group\nUnder Fives\n54\nGOOD/VERY\n223\n54\n5\n4\n90\n30\n4\n3\n90\nTenants' Assoc.\n66\n8\n73\nBWFYA Co-op\n41\n1\n91\nPensioners' Group\n33\n3\n2\n100\n3\n8\n118\n7.17 Looking at the figures for the Youth Association first, some\nimportant factors emerge. Firstly, over three-quarters of the estate\nhad heard of the Youth Association - considerably more than any\nother group. Secondly, over four-fifths of those that had heard of the\nassociation thought it was either doing a good job or a very good job\n157",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nWHO LIVES ON BROADWATER FARM- WHAT DO THEY THINK?\nof work. Given the way in which the press has attacked the\nassociation this represents a very high degree of support indeed.\nWhatever else is said about community organisation on the estate we\nfeel we can say that the association has the support of the great\nmajority of residents. It is equally significant that the other groups\nhave a high level of support. While fewer people have heard of them;\nthose that have are pleased that they are working. no\n7.18 The question of active involvement is different for the Mothers'\nGroup, the Under Fives' group and the Pensioners' Group - these\nexist to provide services for only a small part of the residents. Thus\n5% of people had been to a meeting of the Mothers' Group in the last\ntwo months a group of some 100 people. Since there are only some\n450-500 mothers on the estate this represents a large proportion of\nthis group. It is certain that there, 100 people would represent a much\nhigher proportion of that specific group. Similarly both the\nPensioners' and Under Fives' groups would not expect the active\ninvolvement of people who were not in that section of the community.\nThe Co-op has been recently formed with very specific aims with\nregard to economic regeneration, and would not expect a mass\ninvolvement.\n7.19 The active involvement of so few in the Tenants' Association\nand the Youth Association does need some further comment. Both\norganisations have spent much of the last four years bringing\nconsiderable resources to the whole estate. Many people have\nexperienced the result of their campaigns through their significantly\nbetter housing and environmental conditions. We do not believe that\na large proportion of the estate would have to be involved in these\norganisations for them to be able to claim representativeness. They\nobviously have the support of a large majority of residents and must\nnot be judged by different criteria than we would judge other\nrepresentative organisations. In 1986, British society is not one that\nhas the active involvement of a very high proportion of its citizenry.\nWe return in Chapter 9 to the need for more active involvement of\npeople on the estate. People support organisations without attending\ntheir meetings.\n7.20 PROBLEMS ON THE ESTATE\nWe wanted to know how people perceived the problems on the\nestate.\n158\nAre the following a big problem, a bit of a problem or not really a\nproblem?:-\n%\nUnemployment\nPoor housing\nThe behaviour of the police\nPoor street lighting\nPoor schools\nPoor public transport\nCrime\nRace relations\nGeneral unfriendliness\nNot enough places for\nchildren to play\nNot enough things for\nyoung people to do\n20847\n29\nNot really\nA bit of A big\na problem problem\n4\n94\n18\n42\n50\n21\n29\n45\n29\n26\n45\n23\n32\n41.5\n125\n33.5\n21\n22\n57\n37.5\n25\n37.5\nbb52\n26\n22\n1038\nT18\n45\nb24\n57\nanswer\nthe\n199\nabout\nFirst and foremost we must underline\nunemployment. The residents nearly all understand just how deeply\nthis effects everyone. It is the nearest to a unanimous answer as exists\nin the whole survey. Secondly, all of the other issues have between\nthree-quarters and a half of the estate feeling that they are a problem\nof some order. Crime and lack of youth facilities are seen as a big\nproblem by some 57% of the estate. Residents clearly recognise the\nimportance of lack of provision for youth as a part of its problems.\n7.21 We will return extensively to the attitudes about crime. Here\nthough, it is important for us to understand that people feel that there\nare big problems for people in living on the estate. Indeed in answer\nto the question - Do you like living on the estate? - 51% said yes\nand 49% said no. Given the labelling of the estate outlined in Chapter\n2, and given the events of the last year, this is not surprising. It is an\nimportant element of people's lives, and one that all agencies must\ntake into account. Many people in giving evidence to the Inquiry\npleaded for a return to normal - it is essential that nothing stands in\nthe way of this.\nPOLICE ACCOUNTABILITY\n7.22 The issue of police accountability has become a matter of\n159",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nWHO LIVES ON BROADWATER FARM- WHAT DO THEY THINK?\ncentral importance not just to the work of this Inquiry, but also within\ndiscussion about public attitudes to the police. We therefore asked a\nseries of questions about who should decide policing in the locality.\nWho should decide how a local area is policed?\nScotland Yard\nYES NO\n31\n69\nLocal police station\n68\n32\nHome Secretary\n25\n75\nLocal council\n71\n29\nLocal magistrates\n21\n79\n222222\n7.23 It is undoubtedly the case, following the disturbances, that\nthree of them played a role in deciding local policing of the area -\nScotland Yard, the local police station and the Home Secretary. Two\nof these bodies are unwelcome to over two-thirds of the residents of\nthe estate whilst the local police station is seen as acceptable.\nConstitutionally, local magistrates and the local council have no role\nto play in deciding local policing and whilst four-fifths of the estate\nwere pleased with this state of affairs with regard to the magistrates,\nover two-thirds believe that the local council should play a role in\npolicing decisions. This is higher than in any other survey about police\naccountability. This is obviously important for two different areas of\nour report. Firstly it does underline the fact that the London Borough\nof Haringey as an organisation is felt to be capable of deciding on\nsocial policy in a general sense. This is surprising because for many\ncouncil estates one of the last organisations trusted by council tenants\nto be capable of running anything is their landlord. On Broadwater\nFarm this appears to be different. Secondly, and specifically with\nregard to policing matters, it is important to realise that people do feel\nthat the local council should have a say alongside of the local police\nstation in deciding policing policy. For a locality with such a\ntroubled experience of policing, as well as one where the question of\nto whom the police should be accountable is an issue sharply\ncontested by the police and local community groups, these aspirations\nare highly important.\n-\n7.24 If we compare this figure to the Islington Crime Survey\nwhere only 8% of the population saw the council as having a role in\nthe decisions about policing - we can appreciate this response about\nthe London Borough of Haringey.og for\n160\nT\nASSISTING THE POLICE WITH THEIR ENQUIRIES\n7.25 We wanted to know whether the residents of the estate would\nassist the police in a number of situations and we found that their\nresponse was very specific to different situations. \"I would like to ask\nyou how far you would be prepared to assist the police in certain\nsituations. For each example would you tell me if you would be\nprepared to identify the people who did it, and whether you would be\nprepared to give evidence in court.?\"\n% of those that answer that they would\nHelp\nidentify\nGive Would do\nevidence neither\nYouths smashing up a bus shelter\nYouths knock a man down and\ntake his wallet\n43\n32\n53\n63\n50\n30\n76\n70\n14\n36\n26\nA traffic accident where\nsomeone was badly hurt\nA conversation between two\npeople planning a break in\n14\n60\n60\n7.26 There is no simplistic and total rejection of either the law or the\npolice force contained within these answers. Rather it demonstrates\nthe way in which residents are quite prepared to help the police with\ntheir enquiries in certain areas. In particular they are prepared to help\nin those areas of crime that they feel the police are capable of dealing\nwith. Over 80% of residents were prepared to help the police in a\ntraffic accident; over 70% would assist in terms of a mugging, but\nunder half would do anything about vandalism or conspiracy to\nburgle. It is insufficient explanation for the police or anyone to label\nthe residents of the estate as \"unhelpful\" to the police or against\nlaw and order. The reality is more complex and must be seen as in\npart a measure of the community's confidence in police efficiency.\nHOW WELL DO THE POLICE PERFORM?\n-\n7.27 We felt that residents' opinions about police success would be\nan important part of their overall attitudes to the police. As a\nconsequence we asked them how successful the police are at dealing\nwith particular sorts of crime?\n161",

As such\nthey don't tell us anything about what police actually achieve, just\nwhat Broadwater Farm residents THINK they achieve, in a number of\nareas. Whilst nearly two-thirds of the estate feel that the police have\nsome success in dealing with fighting in the streets and drunken\ndriving, around two-thirds feel that they have little success in dealing\nwith burglaries, vandalism, sexual assaults, the control of heroin\ndealing, street robbery and domestic disputes.\nWHAT SHOULD THE POLICE CONCENTRATE ON?\n7.29 In connection with this, it is important to understand the way in\nwhich the residents of the estate view those police tasks that they think are\nimportant. It is interesting then to compare this with the way in which the\nLondon Borough of Islington survey and the Policy Studies Institute\nsurvey for the whole Metropolitan area see policing issues.\n% Prioritising these crimes\nfor the police to deal with\n7438\nBWF\nICS\nIslington\nPSI\nMetropolitan area\nSexual assaults on women\n84\n70\n79\nHeroin control\n69\n59\n40\nMugging\n66\n71\nDomestic burglary\n66\n58\nRacial assaults\n00\n68\n59\n39\nBag snatching\n30\n25\nDrunken driving\n27\n44\nCannabis\n14\n13\n162\nOffice burglary\nStreet rowdyism\nShop lifting\n13\n12\n6\n9\n1222\n11 do\n26\n26\n0872\n10 8\n8\n10\n3\n7.30 Thus, over two-thirds of the people on the estate want the\npolice to prioritise burglary, mugging, the control of heroin dealing\nand four-fifths the sexual assaults on women. Yet as we saw above, it\nis these same areas of concern that more than two-thirds of the estate\nfeel that the police are not very successful in dealing with.\n7.31 But if we compare this to the London Borough of Islington and\nthe whole Metropolitan area we find a similar spread. People in\nLondon think the police should prioritise the safety of women from\nsexual assault; the problem of personal safety on the street and\nrobbery in the street and at home. The one important and marked\ndifference is to be found in the level of concern about the dealing in\nheroin from the people of Broadwater Farm. The deep anxiety about\nthe problem of heroin dealing once more demonstrates a sharp sense\nof the necessity for its own self-defence against the deep dangers of\nhard drugs. It is inconceivable that a group of heroin dealers could\nsurvive within such a large community if they acted at all openly.\n7.32 Equally the residents on the estate agree with the residents of\nIslington about those activities that the police spend too much time\non. That is the issues of prostitution, cannabis and shoplifting.\nImportantly, the estate is in line with these wider areas in making the\nsharp distinction between different sorts of crimes. There is no overall\nand simplistic rejection of law and order: there is no simplistic\nrejection of the police, rather there is a consistent attempt to protect\nthemselves from crimes that they think are important alongside the\nbelief that it is these areas that the police do not deal with. This must\nbe of great importance to us since there is an attitude that we have\noutlined above which sees the residents of the estate as criminals. Our\nevidence is to the contrary.\n163",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nJOHW\nWHO LIVES ON BROADWATER FARM- WHAT DO THEY THINK?\n7.33\nHOW DO RESIDENTS VIEW POLICE ACTIVITY\nOne of the ways of measuring the way in which the residents of the\nestate view the police is to ask them views they may have about police\nconduct in arresting people, obtaining evidence and obtaining a\nconviction.\nConsequently we asked: When they are questioning people do you\nthink that police officers ever....\nNever Hardly Sometimes Often Very\noften\never\n-\nThese differences are very striking indeed. They mean that the\npeople on the estate with the exception of bribes are\nconsiderably more likely than the rest of London to believe that the\npolice engage in malpractice.\n7.35 How does the estate have such a bad view of the police? The\nsurvey asked whether the respondent or a close friend had actually\nhad direct experience of these malpractices. They were also asked\nwhether they or a close friend had witnessed the malpractice.\nCompared with the PSI London Survey the results are most startling.\nUse threats to get the\nanswer they want\n29\n7\n35\n20\nFalsify statements made to them\n29\n10\n36\n15\n45\n10\nBWF\nLondon\n9\nHas the malpractice happened to you or to\nsomeone you know\n60\n12\nUse unnecessary force\nwhen making arrests\nUse violence in police stations\n26\n22\n28\n7\n35\n18 12\nHas it been witnessed by you or by someone\nyou know\n61\n14\n12\n34\n20 10\nPlant evidence on people\n34 12\n34\n13\n7\nAccept money as a bribe\n43\n20\n28\n5\n4\n7.34 This table must be of profound concern to everyone. Whilst it\ndoes demonstrate that a consistent level of 30% of residents believe\nthat the police NEVER engage in malpractices, it also demonstrates\nthat a majority of people on the estate believe that the police\nsometimes (or more often) use threats to get answers, falsify\nstatements, use force and violence and plant evidence on people.\nThese are very high figures indeed if we compare them to the PSI\nsurvey of London:-\n% who believe that the police\nUse threats to get the answer that they want\nFalsify statements made to them\nBWF\nSometimes\nnois London\nOften/Very Often\n65\nNot Available\n60\n34 mar\nUse unnecessary force when making arrests\nUse violence at police stations\n65\n64\n38 ild\n38\nPlant evidence on people\nTake bribes\n164\n54 Not Available\n37\n56bi\n-\n7.36 This means that some three-fifths of the estate's adults - that is\nabout 750 people - have either experienced or witnessed or their\nclose friends have experienced or witnessed police malpractices\ncompared to between 12 and 14% in London. This underlines the fact\nthat their perception is based upon specific experiences.\nx sill\n7.37 Therefore a large proportion of the residents of the estate,\nwhilst they have clear priorities about the nature of crime that has to\nbe tackled, also feels that the police engage in malpractices. If\ntwo-thirds of the estate believe that the police engage in malpractices\nand two-thirds believe that they are ineffectual in dealing with those\nareas of criminality that are important for their safety, it's not\nsurprising that half of the estate will not assist the police with their\nenquiries into certain crimes.\n7.38 FAIRNESS AND THE POLICE\nWe also wanted to find out whether people saw the police's\nunderstanding of the issues on the estate as good and whether the\npolice treated all sorts of people fairly\nTherefore the survey asked: Would you say that the police\noperating on the estate...\n165",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nT\nF\nF\nHad a good understanding of the problems on the estate?\nTreat people of all sorts fairly and equally?\nYes No\n49 51\n49 51\nI\n1\n7.39 We also asked people whether the police stopped and searched\npeople without good reason. 43% said yes. Of these they believed\nthat the categories of people that the police were likely to stop and\nsearch without good reason were:-\nBlack\nYoung\nMen\nWhite\nWomen\nOld\n95\n93\n67\n10\n51\n526520\n28\n10\nThis means that 40% of the estate believe that the police stop and\nsearch young Black people without good reason.\n7.40 POLICING BY CONSENT?\nWhat does this range of answers mean for police community\nrelations? Firstly, it further underlines the fact that one-half of the\npeople on the estate would have little confidence in the way in which\nthe estate is policed. This must undermine the effectiveness of\npolicing since, as we have seen from other questions, people are\nunlikely to assist a police force that they think is unfair, lacks\nunderstanding of their problems, uses unnecessary force and falsifies\nevidence. Under these circumstances policing by consent is not\npossible since for those people, consent has been withdrawn.\n7.41 Secondly, we must underline the fact that one half of the estate\nbelieves that the police do understand and are fair and for one-third\nof the estate they consistently believe that the police never engage in\nmalpractices. It may be argued that having the support and confidence\nof one-half of the community is a good record. Yet in comparison to\nthe survey carried out across the London Borough of Islington (ICS\n1985), these figures are low. Some two-thirds of the people of\nIslington believe that the police never engage in malpractices. Even\nwith figures such as these, there is a consistent minority who would\nhave very little confidence. On the Broadwater Farm, from these\nfigures it appears that between one-half and two-thirds of the estate\nhave these worries.\nWHO LIVES ON BROADWATER FARM- WHAT DO THEY THINK?\n7.42 In the Caribbean Times of 13th June 1986, the Home Secretary\nmade the following important points:-\n\"The police force in Britain is an instrument for protecting not\ncoercing citizens. Policing in this country is based on the concept of\nthe citizens in uniform. The police go about their duties in the vast\nmajority of occasions unarmed. Such a philosophy of policing can\nonly be successful if the police can draw strength and support from\nthe community that they serve.\"\nWe also believe that this philosophy can only succeed if the police\ndraw strength and support from the community and therefore view\nwith alarm the fact that so many people on the estate have such bad\nexperiences of policing that they find they cannot give it.\n7.43 This issue was so important that we have categorised a range of\nanswers by gender, age, and race. The following figures are\ncategorised therefore by age across the top and gender and race down\nthe side. Breaking down the answers to whether the police are fair or\nnot:-\n% Who believe that\nThe police are unfair\nWhite men\nBlack men\nWhite women\nBlack women\n16-24 25-44 45 plus All\n67\n56\n10\n48\n75\n48\n55\n59\n51\n36\n12\n34\n73\n33\n72\n4758\nFor the whole estate there was a feeling from 51% that the police\nwere unfair. Here we can see the way in which age and ethnicity effect\npeople's beliefs about the police. Young people believe they are\nunfair more than their relevent older categories but so do Black\npeople.\n-\n7.44 Looking at the question of malpractice by the police we can see\nthis pattern re-emerge.\nDo you believe that the police sometimes/often/very often threaten\nwhen questioning?\n166\n167",

In this case the group is\nBlack, under the age of 45, both men and women. The principal\ncharacteristic of this group is their colour.\n168\nTHE COMMUNITY VIEW OF CRIME O\nWe have noted earlier on in our report that some senior police\nofficers always believed that the estate seemed to represent a criminal\nentity. Does our evidence support this view? If over half the estate\nbelieve that police sometimes or more often act wrongly does this\nback up the view that the estate is outside the law?\nWe have already outlined the way in which people on the estate\nseek to involve the police in a different prioritisation in dealing with\nsexual assaults, mugging, burglary and heroin dealing. Not a list of\nactivities that a criminal community would necessarilly arrive at. But\nperhaps one section of the community is different from another.\nAgain this is simply not the case. If we compare the police priorities\nof young Black people with those of the estate we can see they have\nsimilar fears and worries.\nPolice priorities\nSexual assaults\nHeroin dealing\nYoung Black people\nof BWF\nBWF as a\n8912\nwhole %\nddo 84\n74\n69\nRobbery\n54\ntive 66\nBurglary\n64\n66\nRacial attacks\n72\nel59\n169",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nWHO LIVES ON BROADWATER FARM - WHAT DO THEY THINK?\n7.49 We wanted to see if there was a difference between sections of\nthe estate in their overall worry about crime.

These figures contain no evidence that\ncriminality can be a characteristic of the estate.\n-\n7.50 It is interesting to note the extent to which crime has been\nexperienced on the estate. There has been an important new approach\nto this area of research the study of \"victims\" carried out both by\nthe Home Office and by independent researchers. They all uncover\nvarious amounts of unrecorded crime. Therefore, whilst no one has\ndisagreed with the falling crime figures that the police produced and\nthat we cite in Chapter 3, there is inevitably going to be some crime\nunrecorded. Consequently we asked the following set of questions.\nHas the following happened to you or to someone living in your\nhousehold in the last 12 months? We compare this with Sussex Ward\nin Islington one of the wards containing council estates and\nsurveyed in the I.C.S.\n% of respondents who are victims\nHas your home been burgled to\nTried to break into your home\nHad your house vandalised\nenced or wins 6 this m42\nHad car/van motor bike broken into or stolen\nHad car/van motor bike vandalised\nBeen mugged or robbed on the street\nBeen physically attacked\nBeen threatened with violence\nWomen been sexually attacked\nWomen been sexually pestered\n7.51 On Broadwater Farm, as elsewhere, there is a quantity of\nunrecorded crime, especially in the field of burglary and vandalism.\nHowever, the figures for Broadwater Farm are in every case less than\nthe Sussex Ward in Islington. What does this comparison mean? At\nthe very least, it means that we cannot classify the estate as a high\ncrime area. There are whole wards in Islington where there are much\nmuch higher incidents of crime. Once more the survey cannot support\nthe view that the estate is a criminal community.\n7.52 We asked people whether they thought crime had gone down\ncompared to five years ago.\nWould you say that the following crimes are more common,\nless common, or about the same as they were five years ago?\nMore\ncommon\nThe Less\nsame common\nPeople being robbed and mugged\nin the street\n35\n10 55\nPeople's houses being burgled\nVandalism and deliberate damage\nto property\n33\n10\n57\n36\n13\n51\nSexual assaults on women\n39\n11\n50\n36\nOver one-half of the whole estate believe that every single crime\nmentioned has gone down in the last five years and of course it is\nimportant and significant that over one-third feel that it has gone up.\nHowever, if we compare these with Islington, the difference is most\nstriking.\nM\nBWF Sussex Ward\n12\n23\n13 Not available\nMore The\ncommon same\nLess\ncommon\n6\n7 l\nRobbery/Mugging\n61\n28\n12\n6\n52\n7\n15\nBurglary unimo to\nVandalism\nbatab adal67\n23\n10\n54\n30\n16\n7\n22\nSexual assaults\n48\n32\n20\n9\nNot available\nw2\n10\n7 Not available\n7.53 These differences in perception are very striking. Whilst one-\nhalf of the estate think that crime is less common it varies between\n170\n171",

Once more we must ask whether\nthese perceptions can be about a criminal community?\nmo\n7.54 However, we return to the important fact that 57% of the\nestate think crime is a big problem irrespective of whether it is\nactually lower than elsewhere or irrespective of whether they think\ncrime has gone down over the last five years. We also asked people\nwhether they believed crime was carried out by people on the estate\nor outside of it. 81% of the estate believed that crime was carried out\nby people from off the estate. Therefore, even for those people who\nbelieve that crime is a problem, a large proportion must see the\ncriminals as coming from outside. Again hard evidence from people\non the estate suggests to us that it cannot be seen as a community of\ncriminals.\n7.55 To further check we also asked a series of questions about\nthose police tasks that were perceived as of major importance and\nreceived the following replies.\nList in order of majority saying they were of importance...\n38858\nImmediate response to 999 calls\nDetection of criminals\n93\n80\nDeterring criminals\n68\nCrime prevention advice\n57\nContain rowdy behaviour\n50\nControlling crowds\n49\nCheck the security of shops and offices 41\nLost property-\n39\nRoad traffic control\n38\nMaintaining contacts with schools\n36\nYouth work\n30\nresponded to, deterred and detected; all traditional views of the\npolicing role. They are not interested in police doing youth work,\nschool work or the \"softer view\". Yet it is necessary to view these\nresponses from the estate in the light of all of the others. The majority\nof people want crime to be dealt with quickly; they want the police to\ndeal with certain crimes as a much higher priority than others, yet,\nthey believe that these are the crimes that the police are not very\nsuccessful in dealing with and two-thirds of them believe that the\npolice engage in malpractices. Therefore whilst they recognise the\nimportance of the \"fight against crime\" for their own security\ntwo-thirds of them have little confidence in the police capacity to\nengage in that fight. Until police have gained that confidence it is\nunlikely that the residents will feel enthusiastic about the force's\nability to increase Broadwater Farm's security.\n7.57 D.A.C. Richards had said on Diverse Reports in October\n1986:-\n\"It is the ill-doer, it is the person who is offending the law who\nobjects to the presence of the police in the estate.\"\nIt may well be that this statement is meant to disarm all criticism of\npolice activity on the estate lest the critic be labelled a criminal. Our\nsurvey demonstrates not only that there is considerably concern about\nthe police activity but that this estate is also concerned about crime. It\nis evident that people other than criminals can be critical of the police.\nOnce more it is difficult to imagine that these responses could ever\ncome from a community of criminals. Would they be in favour of\nquicker responses to 999 calls, the detection of criminals and the\ndeterrence of crime?\n7.56 Yet in a simple sense the opponents of community policing may\nfeel that they gain some support from these statistics, as they appear\nto reflect a demand for traditional policing. The estate wants crime\n172\n173"

            "S. 1769\nbe Chapter 8 in ni bavil odw\nLOOKING FORWARD - JUSTICE FROM THE LAW\nWHY DID IT HAPPEN?\n8.1 In this Chapter and the next we turn to the future. Before doing\nso we pause to review the evidence which has been related so far and\nto see what it tells us about the causes of the disturbances of 6th\nOctober. In Chapter 2 we described the growth of community\norganisations on the Broadwater Farm Estate, and their success in\nturning back what appeared to be a dreadful failure of municipal\nhousing policy. That success is worth reporting on and learning from,\nirrespective of the events of October 1985; and in Chapter 9 we make\nproposals designed to recognise and build on that success, and to\nencourage the development of other self-reliant and forward looking\ncommunities. As we explain in the Chapter, the need to invest\nresources in developing such communities is based on social justice\nand on the general community interest. Investing resources in a\ncommunity such as Broadwater Farm, whose members are ready to\ncomplement the investment with their own dedication and hard work,\nwill generate more jobs, better living conditions, and a happier life for\nmany people. Such an investment will not in itself avert conflicts with\nthe police; nor has the absence of resources been in any meaningful\nsense a cause of those conflicts.\n8.2 The reason for the fighting which erupted on 6th October with\nsuch appalling consequences for the police and the community, is to\nbe found rather in the history which we have traced in Chapter 3 of\nfailed initiatives in police/community relations; and in the dreadful\nsequence of events which started with the arrest of Floyd Jarrett and\nwhich continued until the clash at Willan Road. That clash as we have\nseen was between a group of youths who, along with many others,\nwere full of sorrow and anger because a mother had died and because\n189",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nLOOKING FORWARD: JUSTICE FROM THE LAW\nnothing effective was being done about her death; and a unit of police\nofficers who were, with many others in reserve, heavily equipped,\nhostile to the people on the estate, expecting trouble to start, and\nready at a moment's notice to quell it with force. Thus the\ndisturbances came about because of an appalling state of distrust and\nhostility which existed on 6th October between the police and the\npeople who lived in and frequented Broadwater Farm. To explain\nwhy that had come about had been the purpose of our analysis of\nevents in Chapters 3 and 4.\n8.3 Reviewing the salient findings of those Chapters, we can\nconclude that there would have been far less likelihood of serious\ndisturbances if all, or even a few, of the following had taken place:-\n(1) If the top leadership of the police in Y District had\nrecognised, encouraged and responded wholeheartedly to the\ncommunity organisations on Broadwater Farm.\n(2) If serious efforts had been made both by the home beat\nofficers on the estate and their superiors, to ensure that those\nofficers knew, understood and respected the members of the\nBroadwater Farm Youth Association.\n(3) If the contradiction between co-operative community policing\nand the incursion of intimidatory mobile units had been resolved by\nthe local police command.\n(4) If there had been goodwill on the part of both the police\nleadership and the council, to work together in setting up a\nconsultative forum in which all interests in the borough were\nrepresented.\n(5) If the police had come forward and discussed their concerns\nabout policing on the estate at the Broadwater Farm Panel.\n(6) If the drug pushers who began to appear on the estate had\nbeen arrested or otherwise prevented from committing their crimes\non the estate.\n(7) If the other community leaders who were available during the\nabsence of Dolly Kiffin had been recognised and trusted by the\npolice during August and September in order to resolve the\nproblems which were developing.\n(8) If there had been adequate procedures at Tottenham Police\nStation to prevent officers going off on a speculative and unjustified\nsearch of Mrs Jarrett's home, which in the event led to her tragic\nand untimely death.\n-\n(9) If that tragedy having happened\n-\nthe police authorities\nhad immediately acted to suspend the officers involved and to\ndemonstrate their desire for the full truth about the tragedy to be\nuncovered.\n(10) If during the evening of 6th October the police had\nmaintained the restrained response which they had shown during\nthe afternoon demonstration.\n8.4 Examining these questions provides a much truer account of the\ningredients of the disturbances than does a simplistic, and in our view\nmisguided explanation that the disturbances were caused by\nwickedness or criminality. In saying that, we recognise that in the\nhistory we have outlined, things were done against the police which\nwere reprehensible. In Chapter 3 we gave a similar description to the\nstriking of a police officer with a bottle; to the striking of a police\nofficer with a billiard cue; and to the stabbing of an officer with a\nknife all criminal acts which happened on the estate in 1982 and\n1983. We recognise also that police work is difficult and dangerous\nand that injury to (and even more the death of) a police officer\ngenerates a reaction among colleagues of both anger for what has\nhappened and fear of what may happen to them. Relations can be\npoisoned between the police and the whole community of people\nwhich they see as being ready to do similar acts. We have shown that\non Broadwater Farm the reprehensible things which were done were\nthe isolated acts of particular individuals, and were not the acts of a\ncriminal community.\n8.5 Nor do we accept the explanation put forward by many\nnewspapers, that the estate was seething with tensions which would\nhave sparked a riot in any event, and that it only needed a \"trigger\" to\nset it off. On that view, the death of Mrs Jarrett is seen as the\n\"trigger\", but any other event might equally have served. Such an\nanalysis seriously underestimates the magnitude of that tragedy. It\nwas, so far as we know, unprecedented for an innocent Black woman\nto have died as a direct consequence of a police operation. When one\nadds together:\n(1)\n(2)\n-\nthe shock and sorrow of that event;\n-the natural association of it with the shooting of Mrs Cherry\nGroce;\n-\n(3) the distrust, justified in the event, of the mechanisms for\ninvestigating the tragedy;\n190\n191",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nLOOKING FORWARD: JUSTICE FROM THE LAW\n(4) - the pre-existing bad relations between rank and file police\nofficers and people on the estate;\n(5) -the accumulated bitterness of years of experienced\nmalpractice, as confirmed strikingly for the Broadwater Farm\nresidents by our survey;\nthen the ingredients of an uncontrollable confrontation were present.\nWithout the first three factors, all stemming from the death of Mrs\nJarrett, we do not believe that the disturbances would have occurred,\nas we explained at the end of Chapter 3.\n-\nbob\n8.6 But even then, that confrontation might have been averted, and\nwas for a time averted, by a strategy of controlled policing. What\nfinally happened was the worst possible provocation - the blocking of\nthe free movement of people leaving the estate to go to the police\nstation, as their practice had been at other such times. Many Black people\nhave spoken to us powerfully about how they have been constricted\nall their lives by inequalities of education, by discrimination in\nemployment, by the abuse of stop-and-search and other police\npowers. On the estate in particular the fear had taken a physical\nshape. One witness told us that in discussions among the youth about\nthe police on the estate \"there was always this dread that the police\ncould hem them in\". With the deployment of riot police at every\nentrance, spreading out and blocking the roads, that dread became\nreality. For even though some people were allowed in and out during\nthe evening of 6th October, the evidence is that the vast majority of\nyoung Black people were not allowed to leave by the roads off the\nestate from about 7.00pm onwards.\n8.7 As we described in Chapter 6, the consequences of the\ndisturbances have been horrendous. The intensity of the fighting and\nabove all the death of a police officer, have for many police officers\nbeen a confirmation of everything bad which they believed about\nBroadwater Farm. The immense scale of the arrest and search\noperation has put the community in fear and has caused people to\nbelieve, with reason, that they are the targets of exceptional\nsurveillance and oppressive action. Criminal trials will continue for\nmany months, causing hardship and anxiety for those on trial and\ntheir families. Many people are involved in the Broadwater Farm.\nDefence Campaign, which aims to give support and assistance to\nthose on trial and their families. While the trials continue, it is\ndifficult for either the community or the police to do anything other\n192\nthan relive the conflicts of the past. If abnormally heavy sentences\nare imposed, the bitterness will endure still further, and the task of\nreconstruction and reconciliation will become even more difficult.\n8.8 Even so we must look forward. As we showed in Chapter 7,\npeople on the Broadwater Farm Estate remain very anxious about\ncrime; but they have limited confidence in the capacity of the police\neither to solve crime or to act fairly and lawfully towards them. One\nwitness, Mrs Scott summed up the sentiments of many other\nwitnesses, when she articulated in a sentence the problem which must\nsomehow be resolved:-\n\"I would really like to be able to respect the police.\"\n8.9 We therefore approached the question \"What can be done?\"\nwith some anxiety. We have made it clear that we are not equipped to\ndraw up a comprehensive blueprint for the resolution of police/\ncommunity relations in Haringey. Many who have read the preceding\nChapters will have more experience of policing than any of us and\nmay have better proposals to make. We have been limited by time\nand the amount of expert research which we can assimilate. We\npropose therefore in this Chapter and the next to reflect some of the\nproposals which have been put forward in evidence, and to add\nproposals which seem sensible to us after all we have heard. We do\nnot express them as recommendations, but rather as proposals which\ncan be discussed, improved, and acted on by people who in many\ndifferent ways have responsibility for the welfare of the community.\nPOLICING IN TOTTENHAM\n8.10 From April 1986, Chief Superintendent Alan Stainsby was\nappointed Chief Officer of the Tottenham Division. The only role\nwhich he played in the events which we have narrated was that on the\nevening of 5th October he came over from Enfield, where he was then\nChief Officer, to take charge temporarily at Tottenham after the\ndeath of Mrs Jarrett. He behaved with complete correctness in going\nat once to 25 Thorpe Road to express his sympathies to the Jarrett\nfamily and to tell them of the decision to set up an investigation under\nthe supervision of the P.C.A. On 6th October Chief Superintendent\nCouch had returned, and so far as we are aware Chief Superintendent\nStainsby was not involved in any of the policing decisions which took\nplace on that day. We have also noted that he attended a meeting of\nthe Broadwater Farm Panel soon after being appointed, and\n193",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nLOOKING FORWARD: JUSTICE FROM THE LAW\npresented a written report. He has met with Dolly Kiffin and other\nrepresentatives of organisations on the estate. He has expressed his\ndesire, in principle, to see a substantial reduction of the level of\npolicing on the estate. Coming in at this time he has a heavy burden of\nresponsiblity to bear, and we wish him well.\n8.11 The task can be summarised as the task of introducing genuine\ncommunity policing into Tottenham. Both police officers and\nmembers of the public talk often of the need for \"policing by consent\"\n- but what does that mean? The term \"community policing\" has\nbecome so hackneyed that it may be useful to use another term to\ndescribe what we have in mind - \"co-operative policing\", by which\nwe mean a policing strategy by which the police at all levels co-\noperate (on the basis of mutual respect and equality) with those\nvarious agencies which represent the community, in order to deter\nand detect those crimes which the community believe to be priority\nevils.\n8.12 There are several elements in that definition. First there must\nbe genuine co-operation which means a real exchange of\ninformation about the problems which are troubling either police or\ncommunity, and about the operations which may have to be mounted\nto deal with them. The experience of the drug pushers on Broadwater\nFarm must never be repeated. There, both police and community\nwanted action, but there was no dialogue about how it should be\ntaken. There is much which can be discussed about the tactics of\ndealing with particular kinds of crime, without jeopardising the\neffectiveness of the operations themselves. Chief Executive Roy\nLimb, who has had close experience of dialogue both with the police\nand community organisations, gave this view about what was\nneeded:-\n\"There is no doubt that we have to get into much closer\nconsultation with the police. I have great hopes that the new Chief\nSuperintendent of Tottenham is of a similar mind, and that there\nwill be many three-cornered meetings between the various bodies\nthe Tenants' Association, the Youth Association and so on on\nBroadwater Farm and the council and the police to discuss\noperational matters. I put it as crudely as that. What I mean is the\nway in which policing is carried out, because that's the thing that is\nof concern to the people down there.\"\n194\n8.13 Secondly, the co-operation must be on a basis of mutual\nrespect. The people of the community must be prepared to see police\nofficers as individuals - citizens in uniform with a difficult job to do.\nEqually the police must be prepared to listen to and learn from local\npeople talking about the problems of their community, and to act on\nwhat they have learnt. Co-operative policing does not mean a public\nrelations front.\nThis key factor of respect was emphasised by George Martin of the\nWest Indian Leadership Council:-\n\"I have no confidence that they will change, but if they do listen to\npeople like myself who have been telling them this for years, then\nthe first thing they have to do for us to change this thing round is to\ndemonstrate absolutely clearly, both in the street and in the police\nstations and wherever they speak, that they regard Black parents\nadults, as human beings. My feeling is that there is no respect in the\npolice station or on the streets.\"\n8.14 Thirdly, the co-operation has to be at all levels of the police\nforce. One of the most startling revelations in our inquiry was the\nstatement of Woman Police Sergeant Gillian Meynell to Tricia Zipfel,\nconsultant to the Department of Environment, that she had rarely\nbeen on the estate, had never met with Dolly Kiffin or any other key\npeople, and was not allowed to meet with community groups. Tricia\nZipfel herself compared the change in strategy which is needed to the\nchanges pioneered by her own project:-\n\"To get the people at the front end of management on the ground\nwhere it matters, so that they can actually deal face to face with the\npeople that they are serving there and then.\"\nWhile there are differences between housing management and\npolicing there is the same important principle involved in both. All\nthe people who take day to day decisions affecting people's welfare\nmust have a close co-operative relationship with all of them, for if not,\nthe decisions will be taken in ignorance. Liaison with the community\nmust not be shunted off to the community liaison officer.\n8.15 Fourthly, the co-operation must be with the organisations which\nrepresent the community. It is not for the police to choose who\nrepresents the community. This means, for example, that the\norganisations on Broadwater Farm must be accepted as having a\nlegitimate status in the local liaison process. It means also that the\ncouncil's police sub-committee should be listened to and responded\n195",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nLOOKING FORWARD: JUSTICE FROM THE LAW\nto when it takes some initiative on behalf of the council about the\npolicing of the area. As we observed in Chapter 3, it does not infringe\nany sacred principle for the police to work with a council police\ncommittee. Unlike any other organisation, the council has a known\nrepresentative status as the body chosen by the majority of the\nelectorate. We saw in Chapter 7 that 71% of the people in\nBroadwater Farm believed that the council ought to be involved in\npolicing decisions. Without conceding any constitutional ground, the\npolice should be able to give expression to that wish. We note with\ninterest that Chief Superintendent Stainsby, in his first address to the\nCommunity and Police Consultative Group on 15th May, said that he\nrecognised the importance of the local election results and had already\nhad a meeting with Councillor Grant.\n8.16 Finally, co-operative policing means discussions designed to\ndeter and detect those crimes which are the priority concerns for the\ncommunity. We have heard during the Inquiry of two different\nconcepts of policing which are said to be in oppostion: \"hard\" policing\nor \"soft\" a police force or a police service. But we do not believe\nthat there is a contradiction between co-operative policing and law\nenforcement. As our survey has shown, the Broadwater Farm\ncommunity wants positive and effective police action against crimes\nwhich they deplore. A high priority is put by Black people and White,\nyoung and old, on the need to prevent heroin dealing, sexual assaults,\nmugging and burglary. They also consider that the police are\nunsuccessful in dealing with these crimes. While the police have an\noverall duty to enforce the law, they have in practice a huge area of\ndiscretion in the way resources are used. If the police are seen to\nneglect these priority areas and to spend time on, for example,\nshoplifting or road tax offences, resentment in the community will\ncontinue. Co-operation therefore means discussing what are the\npriorities and how they should be tackled. It should also include local\nC.I.D officers and district support unit officers, as well as the home\nbeat team. Any good understanding which might be built up by the\nhome beat officers could be destroyed if, when serious crimes occur, a\nseparate and alien team of officers become involved.\n8.17 We are acutely aware that it is one thing to state principles and\nquite another to implement them. We have seen how ideas which\nwere held by Chief Superintendent Couch were sometimes\nunacceptable to his colleagues and some of his subordinates. We see\n196\nthree principal ingredients in the programme which is needed to make\nco-operative policing a reality in Tottenham:-\n(1) A programme of education and training of officers of all ranks\nin the skills which are needed for co-operative policing in a multi-\nethnic community.\n(2) A commitment demonstrated by the top ranks of the police\nleadership through the ranks downwards to eradicate oppressive and\nracist policing.\n(3) A system of consultation and accountability which is effective\nto secure changes in policing strategy when the community is\nseriously dissatisfied with the service which it is receiving.\nA COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING PROGRAMME\n8.18 The need for training was voiced by witnesses, including Mrs\nScott:-\n\"It's up to the government to do these things, but they have got to\ngive their police more training and they have got to put them in the\nright way, give them the proper training as to handle Black people\nin general.\"\nAnd Arthur Lawrence:-\n\"Better training in their understanding of other ethnic groups\nwould go some way to resolve some of the problems. At one time\nthey used to be some visits by police to youth clubs and all that;\nsomewhere along the line that broke down.\"\nAnd a Black woman:-\n\"The training for the police is vital. Talking to certain policeman,\nmen who are well meaning in many respects, they don't know what\nracism is at all. They just have it and they do not realise how much\nit's affecting other people.\nAnd Tricia Zipfel, drawing on her experience\nher experience of housing\nmanagement, described how when people are the \"old guard type\",\nthen \"they damned well have to be trained into new attitudes, new\napproaches, and new styles of management that are appropriate.\"\n8.19 This need for training is underlined by the fact that\nMetropolitan police officers are not recruited out of the communities\nwhich they are to serve. According to a report by Andrew Tyler in\nTime Out magazine on 14th May 1986, around 70% of officers are\nrecruited from outside the greater London area. In their training\nperiod, they are based in a police section house. Another aspect of\nthe problem is expressed by a Black officer in the article described the\n197",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nLOOKING FORWARD: JUSTICE FROM THE LAW\neffects of this total non-contact with the real community: -\n\"With eight hours a day in the section house, three or four drinking\nand the rest on duty, it gets to the stage where it's embarrassing for\nthem to meet people who aren't policemen. It gets so they can't\ncope with ordinary people and that they come to actually detest any\ngroup apart from themselves. Hard drinking and hard bragging\nabout sexual conquests are prerequisites for being accepted as 'one\nof the boys'. If they do have to mingle, like go to an Asian\ncommunity on house inquiries, they'll come back and slag and slag\nabout how much they stink. And it isn't a small minority, it's the\ncore of the group, I'd say, aged from 18 to 25.\"\n8.20 Senior officers, who should be playing a key role in cracking\ndown on racist and sexist attitudes appear often to condone and\nencourage them. The pages of the Police Studies Institute report\nPolice and People in London, which was commissioned by the\nMetropolitan Police and involved actual observation by researchers\nwho were attached to the Metropolitan Police over two years, reveal\ncase after case of such behaviour by high ranking officers. These are\nsome examples: -\n\"When (a researcher) worked with one crime squad, one of the\nfirst things the uniform sergeant told him was that he thought he\nwould have to get rid of the WPC in the squad, since none of the\nmen wanted to work with her.\"\n\"It was a Detective Chief Inpector who said in an interview that\n'Asians are incapable of telling the truth.\"\"\n\"One of the officers giving the briefing for a large public order\nevent managed to indicate that he sympathised with PCs who found\nBlack people ridiculous even while he was saying that the PCs\nshould not call them 'monkeys' as this might cause trouble.\"\n\"It was a Chief Inspector who (in the aftermath of the Black\nPeople's Day of Action) worked himself up into a frenzy of hatred\nagainst Black people and orchestrated a session of absurd racist\ntalks with a large group of PCs in the canteen.\"\n\"A Commander in a sensitive area spontaneously spoke at length\n(to a researcher) about the alien, unintelligible and threatening\nnature of the West Indian way of life: while some of the points he\nmade were individually valid, what he had to say was, taken as a\nwhole, an expression of hostility towards West Indians, especially\nsince he had nothing to say in their favour. It was quite clear that\nthis Commander had little sense of common humanity with the\n198\nWest Indians who form an important part of the local population.\"\n8.21 In only one of the ten divisions which the researchers studied\ndid they find senior officers who were prepared to exercise their\nleadership in combatting racism. Their description of this division is\nworth quoting:-\n\"In one of the divisions that we studied, the senior management\nteam (chief superintendent and superintendent) were clearly very\nanxious to establish and maintain good relations with members of\nethnic minority groups locally. They showed this by giving their\nown attention to any events or incidents that might act as a focus\nfor racial tensions. They also spent a considerable amount of their\ntime getting to know prominent people belonging to the ethnic\nminority groups locally. They were well aware that there was a\ngreat deal of racialist talk among PCs on the reliefs; they certainly\"\ndid not appear to condone it and they made a (partly successful)\nattempt to stop it while the researcher was there. Although the\nracialist talk continued the PCs were well aware of the policy of the\nsenior management, especially their insistence on giving support to\nthe Asians when under threat from skinheads and supporters of\nextreme right-wing organisations. This policy was often commented\non, was resented by some, but was put into action. It was\nsignificant that the researcher saw a potentially explosive incident\ninvolving West Indians successfully defused in this division.\n8.22 These quotations, from a study made as recently as 1981 to\n1983 indicate the magnitude of the task. From the evidence which we\nhave summarised earlier, we have no doubt that these attitudes are as\nprolific in Tottenham now as they were in 1981 - 83 in the areas\nstudied by the researchers. To change them requires first, an absolute\ncommitment from the senior officers in Tottenham, supported by the\ndeputy assistant commissioner at area level. For example, since it will\nbe necessary to use substantial police time in the training and\nretraining of officers, it may be necessary to have support from\noutside Tottenham to cover essential policing duties. We have seen.\nhow vast numbers of officers were brought into Tottenham from\noutside in October to December 1985 to deal with what we have seen\nto be a crisis. The crisis of racism and alienation from the community\namongst police officers is at least as desperate.\n8.23 In 1983 the Working Party on Community and Race Relations\n199",
            "LOOKING FORWARD: JUSTICE FROM THE LAW\nTHE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nTraining for the Police, published its report. It had been set up by the\nPolice Training Council, and its recommendations were accepted by\nthe Home Office. Among its findings about the attitudes of police\nofficers was the following, with which we fully agree:-\n\"Many officers, of course, appreciate the need for the police to\noffer a full range of services and take pride in discharging all their\nfunctions in a thoughtful and professional manner. There is,\nhowever, a tendency for some, particularly in inner-city areas, to\nregard their task as more or less exclusively one of law\nenforcement. Such a narrow conception of their role can lead\nofficers to exercise their discretion without regard to the effect of\ntheir actions on long-term relations with the public, and to regard\nthemselves as representing an authority apart from the community.\nOfficers who focus exclusively on law enforcement may, in\naddition, assume that all individuals with whom they come into\ncontact are criminally inclined, and take a disparaging and\nmoralistic view towards high crime areas (and the local\npopulations) where the generally accepted means of social control\nmay be relatively difficult to apply.\"\nThe Working Party's general conclusions about existing police training\nmethods were strongly critical:-\n\"There are a number of serious weaknesses in present 'in-force'\ntraining. Not all forces give training in community and race\nrelations and few give training to ranks above sergeant. The aims of\nsuch training as is given are generally unclear and unrelated to the\npractical requirements of the police service. The most serious\ndefect in the content of present training is that it consists, for the\nmost part, simply of information. A narrow range of methods is\nused and neither the training nor individual officers are assessed.\nTraining is not organised to maximum effect. Expertise and\nmaterials available, while adequate for present training, will not be\nso in future.\"\nThe Working Party made a series of recommendations both for\nin-service training and for the training of probationers, designed to\nrectify this serious situation.\n8.24 In some areas of the Metropolitan police at least, this need for\nintensive training at all levels is beginning to be recognized. In a paper\npresented in September 1984 to the Cranfield-Wolfson Colloquium on\nmodels of police/public consultation in Europe, Commander\nAlexander Marnoch, who was in charge of the Lambeth district from\n200\n1981 to 1985, described the introduction of new training programmes.\nHe said it was impossible to exempt police from some of the blame for\nthe alienation of the Black community, in that wrongful attitudes had\nall too often been seen as confirmation of prejudice and the catalyst of\npublic disorder. He continued:-\n\"We must ensure that the men who come (to Lambeth) are well trained\nand carefully selected. For this reason, the training programme for our\nofficers has been enhanced and the element that we call \"policing skills\"\nhas been increased, with a view to ensuring that officers project the\nright attitude to elicit the right response. A recent addition to the\nprogramme for Lambeth has been the development of a district\ntraining unit which, in addition to providing normal \"on the job\"\ntraining, would be used for specialist \"policing skills\" development,\nwith the accent very much on the needs of the community. We\nanticipate that in the next three years this emphasis on training will\nincrease even more and that the unit will come into its own, providing\ntraining for probationers, senior constables and detectives. We have\nestablished a coherent and logical strategy for introducing new recruits\nto the district. The street duty course takes up the first ten weeks of a\nprobationer's career and aims to teach not only local geography and\ncharacteristics but to involve the probationer in operational policing\nin a guided situation. We have effectively attained the six months'\ntraining period Scarman suggested - indeed it is 30 weeks - while\ncommunity relations training for senior officers and experienced\nconstables is greatly featured.\"\n8.25 We welcome this approach in Lambeth, but we question to what\nextent the recommendations of the Working Party have been taken\nseriously in Tottenham. We certainly believe that a training unit similar to\nthat in Lambeth is needed in Tottenham, and that - for a start - all the\nhome beat officers to be attached to Broadwater Farm should attend,\nhowever \"experienced\" they are. We believe that such service training\nprogrammes must involve both local community representatives and\nnon-police experts in a teaching role. We believe that the training of\nprobation officers must be completely reviewed and greatly extended in\nlength. The present 20 weeks at the training college at Hendon is a very\nshort period, in which it is impossible for a trainee to understand, let alone\nmaster, the difficult skills needed to serve the public well, such as an\nunderstanding of civil liberties, an understanding of human relations, and\nan understanding of community organisation.\n201",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nLOOKING FORWARD: JUSTICE FROM THE LAW\n8.26 After the initial period the 'training' of probationers seems too\nmuch to involve the use of probationary officers as extra police\nnumbers, without any real learning programme. Many other professions\nrequire a period of placement for trainees in places where they can gain\nnecessary experience. Specifically we note that Chief Superintendent\nStainsby in his address to the Community and Police Consultative Group\nsaid that he was approaching the local authority regarding the placing of\nprobationers after their initial training. He said: -\n\"I would like to attach them to bodies in the local authorities sphere for\nthem to study the social impact of policing.\"\nWe can think of no better place for such attachments to be started, than at\nthe Neighbourhood Office and the Youth Association on Broadwater\nFarm Estate, and we believe that, if the plan was seriously discussed\nwith community representatives, they would work with it.\n8.27 A comparison between the schemes described in Commander\nMarnoch's paper and the divisional reports issued by the Tottenham\npolice shows how inadequate has been the attention given to training in\nTottenham. In 1984 a divisional strategic plan for Tottenham was\npublished. The foreward stated that: -\n\"The strategy includes an element of quality of service to the public,\nwhich is hoped to provide for a better quality of life for Tottenham and a\ncloser police/community understanding.\"\nThe plan contained not one reference to training. The divisional report for\n1985 contained one reference to in-service training:-\n\"Our fifth objective was to improve the overall skill and effectiveness of\npolice officers from Tottenham divisions. To achieve this aim a series of\none day training courses was organised for community beat officers\nwhere lectures and talks were given by speakers with relevant\nknowledge.\"\nIt is our belief that courses lasting one day for a limited number of officers\nonly scratched the surface of the problem that we have described. The\n1986 report states generally that the force's goal for 1986 is to improve the\nservice to the public by a number of methods, of which the very last in the\nlist is training. There is however no further reference to training in the\nreport, and nothing to indicate that any further attention has been given to\nthe training of officers in the necessary skills which they lack.\nA COMMITMENT TO ERADICATE OPPRESSIVE AND RACIST\nPOLICING\n8.28 Training is only part of the answer. An equally important part is\n202\nsupervision and discipline. The need for the most senior officers to know\nwhat abuses are going on and then stamp on them was stressed by Norton\nMacLean, Principal Youth Officer for Haringey:-\n\"If the senior management in the police were really committed to\nchanging things, then I feel lots of people in the community will go more\nthan half way in meeting them. Now they can demonstrate this\ncommitment by actually prosecuting to the fullest hilt of the law the\nofficers who break the rules.\"\nMr Jarrett made the same point:-\n\"We won't trust the police until we get a written statement going across\nthe whole world saying that any policeman caught telling lies should\nhave been sacked or been dismissed or been disciplined.\"\n-\n8.29 The problem however is that police officers have so much\nindividual discretion to enforce the law as they think fit, that senior\nofficers can evade responsibility by pleading ignorance. Stopping people\nin the street, calling in district support units, obtaining search warrants -\nto take three areas where we have evidence of abuse are all done by\njunior officers with minimal supervision. We have seen how DC Randall\nwas able to carry through the search of Mrs Jarrett's home with little or no\nquestioning from the duty officer Inspector Clark. The Chief Executive\nRoy Limb spoke of this lack of awareness on the part of the senior officers\nof what was going on:-\n\"One thing was clear to me, though I cannot say it was ever admitted by\nthe police, and that was that sometimes the right hand did not know\nwhat the left was doing. There were a number of different police forces\nat work.\"\nMr Limb said that was a familiar experience to him as a senior manager,\nand often he does not know that certain things are happening \"until some\ncouncillor kicks me up the backside\". For police officers who have the\npotential to do more harm to the individual than almost any local authority\nofficer, to be out of control in this way is unacceptable. We have seen how,\non the findings of the P.S.I. researchers, racist behaviour was condoned\nand instigated at the level of very senior ranks. We believe therefore that\ntackling racism and the abuses which flow from it, is a priority which\nrequires clear and strong leadership from the Chief Superintendent of\nTottenham himself, with firm and public backing from all ranks above him\nup to and including the Commissioner of police.\n8.30 How can this be done? We are sorry that we could not have heard\nfrom Chief Superintendent Stainsby himself whether he thought that\n203",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nLOOKING FORWARD: JUSTICE FROM THE LAW\nthere was a need for a commitment to eradicate oppressive and racist\npolicing, and if so how he proposed to carry it through. We asked the\nCommissioner of Police a number of questions about racist behaviour in\nour letter of 6th May 1986 - he did not answer them. In our view such a\ncommitment would have to include:-\n(1) A requirement that over a reasonably long period, no house\nsearch or arrest warrant should be applied for without the authority\nof the Chief Superintendent, or some officer delegated by him in\ncases of emergency;\n(2) A stipulation that every stop-and-search of a person in the\nstreet be reported to the Chief Superintendent with a full reason.\nwhy it was done. In this connection we mention the answer given by\nthe Home Office to Lord Gifford's question:-\n\"How many people were stopped and searched by police officers in the\nTottenham area during each month of 1985; of what ethnic origin they\nwere; and in how many cases the stop was followed by an arrest?\"\nThe answer was that in the first three months there were 867 stops\nresulting in 175 arrests; and in the last nine months there were 413 searches\nfollowed by 51 arrests. After April the basis of recording changed and it\nseems that stops were not recorded. Information on the ethnic\nappearance of those searched was not collected centrally. These are\nworrying statistics, especially as many of the arrests are likely to have been\n\"knock on\" offences (See paragraph 3.5). Hundreds of people who were\ninnocently going about their lawful business have been stopped, and have\nsuffered the humilation of a public search.\n8.31 These requirements should be accompanied by guidance from the\nChief Officer that there should be no stops of Black people on \"hunches\"\nthat they were up to no good; no fishing expeditions to the homes of Black\npeople who were rumoured to be criminals. Search powers should be used\nonly where they was clear evidence of specific crimes. The requirements\nwould also need personal leadership from senior officers; for example,\nthere are many opportunities at briefings before officers leave the police\nstation for senior officers to ram home the message that racist and\noppressive behaviour will not be tolerated. We understand that in other\npolice divisions in London such methods have been effective in reducing\nthe number of oppressive searches. The need to justify a search in the face\nof probing questions of a Chief Superintendent should be a deterrent even\nto the most racist constable.\n8.32 Similar constraints will have to be placed upon the district support\n204\nunits, which are about to be reorganised as a new form of Special Patrol\nGroup serving the whole of a police area. They will be known as\nTerritorial Support Groups. Their job is a difficult one. They have to wait\nor drive around, often for long periods, until called out to help out in some\nemergency or some special operations. They usually have no knowledge\nof the people to whom they are sent. It is therefore vital that they should be\nunder control. The experience of the day when district support units left\nthe Spurs' ground and moved into Broadwater Farm looking for\nsomething to do, must never be repeated. Once again we would suggest\nthat the control must be imposed by direct supervision from the\nappropriate Area and Divisional Chief officers, to whom all operations\nof these units should be reported. The aim must be that officers who call in\nsuch units without good reason, and officers in the units themselves who\nabuse their power, can be called to account and disciplined. The ill-effects\nof using these units where they are not needed cannot be overstated:\nVernon Moore of the West Indian leadership council, put the point\nsuccinctly in saying to us:-\n\"The deployment of \"meat wagons\" in certain areas should be\ndecreased in order to dispel the psychology of fear which the Black\ncommunity is currently experiencing.\"\n8.33 Over and above these specific suggestions, we call for a ruthless\ndetermination to eradicate racism from the police force. Community\ndevelopment officer Laxmi Jamdagni made this call in clear terms:-\n\"I think the single biggest issue here is police racism and the short\nterm and long term effects that that is having.\"\nThe Commissioner's Report for 1985 tells us that there has not been a\nsingle substantiated complaint of racial discrimination since racial\ndiscrimination became a specific disciplinary offence in 1984. To us\nthat speaks volumes, not only about the hopelessness of the police\ncomplaints procedure, to which we return below, but to the low level\nof commitment to take racism in the police force seriously. We urge\nthe senior officers in Tottenham to prove by every means at their\ndisposal by publicity, by example, by training, and by discipline -\nthat disrespect and ill-treatment of Black people because of their\ncolour will not be tolerated under their command, and will be\npunished.\n-\n8.34 We mention in this context the question of the recruitment of\nBlack police officers. It is in our view fallacious to suppose that\nrecruiting drives for Black officers will help to combat racism. The\n205",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nLOOKING FORWARD: JUSTICE FROM THE LAW\nconverse is the case - cracking down on racism will make a job in the\npolice force considerably more attractive to many Black people. They\nwill be far more ready to serve in an organisation which respects them\nas people, which does not abuse them or degrade them, and which\nwill give them the opportunity for promotion in accordance with their\nabilities. Our own view is that we want to see Black people playing a\nfull part in all walks of life, including the police. Advertisements and\ncampaigns aimed at potential Black recruits are to be welcomed, but\nthey will not significantly increase the number of Black officers unless\nthe Metropolitan Police Force at all levels is clearly seen to be\nattacking the racism within its own ranks.\nPOLICING BROADWATER FARM\n8.35 The proposals set out above could be implemented on the\nBroadwater Farm Estate in a way which would, over a period of time,\neffect major improvements in relations between police and residents.\nFirst, we believe it to be essential that there are no officers being\ndrafted in from other divisions outside Tottenham to be part of the\nBroadwater Farm patrol. Secondly, the members of the home beat\nteam must be introduced to the people of the estate which they are\npolicing. This will require most careful liaison and discussion with\nboth the representatives of community organisations and the police.\nMany people in the community have almost lost hope that police\nofficers will respect them as equals, and on the other side we\nunderstand that there is a reluctance on the part of police officers to\nserve on Broadwater Farm, which is still branded in their eyes as a\nviolent and anti-police community. But if, as we have been told, the\nmembers of the home beat team have been selected with care: and if,\nas we believe, the community organisations will respond to a dialogue\nwhich is seen to be genuine, then it can be done. The community is\nentitled to know, and we think want to know, who their police officers\nare. Pat Ford, former chair of the Tenants' Association, said this of\nthe present situation:-\n\"They are still very erratic as they are in their vans, and they are in\nand out, and you get them very thin on the ground one minute and\nloads the next. If they are going to have 12 here, I think they\nshould have 12 here, and I think that we should know their faces,\nand I think they might stand a chance then.\"\nIt must also be very difficult for the home beat officers to be\npatrolling in a community whose prominent members are unknown to\nthem, and where they feel estranged and on edge. We would leave it\n206\nto discussions between senior officers and the representatives of\ncommunity organisations to determine exactly how and when such\ncontact should be made. The attendance of some of the home beat\nofficers at the Broadwater Farm panel would be very helpful.\n8.36 It is not for us to say precisely how many police officers should\npatrol Broadwater Farm. It is evident that for 16 officers to patrol\n1063 dwellings is out of proportion to any other neighbourhood\npolicing operation. Spread over Tottenham, the same ratio would\nrequire about 1000 community beat police officers for the whole of\nTottenham, whereas in reality there are only about 200 constables in\nthe division for every kind of work. People in other neighbourhoods\nare entitled to ask why they cannot have a greater share of community\nbeat policing for themselves. Even so, it is not just the numbers but\nalso the attitudes and behaviour of the officers which mattered. In our\nsurvey 65% said that they thought the existing numbers were about\nright or too few. Sixteen officers who understand and work with the\ncommunity, and who do not call in reinforcements for every minor\npolicing job, will create far less trouble than eight who are hostile and\naloof.\nCONSULTATION AND ACCOUNTABLITY\n8.37 We believe that the present legal position whereby the Home\nSecretary is the police authority for London should be changed, and\nthat London should have a police authority of elected representatives.\nAt present it is virtually impossible for any effective democratic\ncontrol to be placed upon policing in London. Norman Atkinson MP,\nwho declined to give evidence to the Inquiry but spoke to three of us\nprivately, said that we could refer to his experience of how difficult it\nwas to raise any questions about policing strategies on behalf of his\nconstituents. When he raised the matter with the Home Secretary, he\nwould normally be answered by a Minister of State saying that it was\nan operational matter for the Commissioner. Many other public\nservants, such as teachers and social workers, are able to maintain\nstrong professional standards in dealing with individual problems,\nwhile being accountable to elected bodies for the financing and policy\ndirection of their service. In the same way, even though police officers\nas trained experts should have discretion in how the law is enforced,\ntheir budget and general priorities should be determined by a body of\nelected representatives which can call them to account. Without that,\nthe interpretation of the public interest is left entirely to a\n207",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nCommissioner of Police, who is not accessible to MPs or responsible\nto a public mandate. That is not the democratic way.\n8.38\nHowever we do not enter further into the debate about what\nsort of elected police authority, with what powers, there should be.\nThere is a crisis of confidence in the police in Tottenham today, and it\nmust be tackled within today's legal frame work. That means making\nuse of the arrangements for consultation between the police and the\npeople of the area which are required by Section 106 of the Police and\nCriminal Evidence Act 1984, which we quoted at paragraph 3.49.\n8.39 The Home Office has published guidance on the arrangements\nfor local consultation in the Metropolitan Police District. Paragraph 7,\ndealing with membership and organisation, starts as follows:-\n\"If a group is to have the confidence of the local community as the\nfocus for local consultations on policing matters, it is essential that\nits membership should be as representative as possible of that\ncommunity. Groups should be accessible to the public so that the\ncommunity in its widest sense can make a constructive contribution,\nas well as the police, elected representatives and statutory agencies\nThe formation of sub-committees to consider particular\nproblems or initiatives could involve representatives from the\ncommunity who are not members of the group itself.\"\n8.40 The Haringey Police and Consultative Group first met on 31st\nOctober 1965, and its constitution and standing orders were adopted\non 9th January 1986. Members of the Inquiry attended the two\nfollowing meetings on 13th March and 15th May. It was quite\napparent that the Group was not representative of the Haringey\ncommunity. Eric Clarke, chair of the group, accepted this in his\nevidence to us:-\n\"What is missing basically is the Black element in any numbers and\nthe Black element is quite a strong element within Haringey. We\nhad the Standing Conference and a couple of bits and pieces, which\nare good bits and pieces, but no, I wouldn't think we were\nrepresentative of the electors of Haringey at all.\"\nHe believed that the biggest inhibiting factor to Black organisations\njoining was the attitude of the Borough Council which had not taken\npart. In a dialogue with a number of Black members of the public who\nintervened during his evidence, his position was that the group was\nopen for them to join, and if they wanted the group to concern itself\n208\nLOOKING FORWARD: JUSTICE FROM THE LAW\nwith the grievances of the Black community, it was for them to come\nalong and voice them. They however were saying that for the Group\nto be acceptable it must show itself ready to deal with the injustices\nsuffered by Black people, and of this they saw no sign.\n8.41 It is necessary to examine how the present situation has come\nabout. If the intention of the group was to bring together as wide a\nrange of community interests as possible, in accordance with the\nHome Office guidance - it would have had a list of 1,200\norganisations in Haringey to call upon. Both the Haringey Council\nand the Haringey Council for Voluntary Service have compiled\nextensive lists of all organisations in the borough and these lists are\nupdated regularly. The Haringey Council for Voluntary Service has\ncomputer-based lists of 1,200 organisations from which can be\nretrieved any groupings of organisations required for a particular type\nof mailing. The council's community affairs department produces an\nupdated directory regularly.\n8.42 The initiative for the present Consultative Group first began on\n6th June 1985 when an exploratory meeting took place, at which\naccording to D.A.C. Richards \"a good section of community\nrepresentatives were invited\". In fact the conveners of that meeting\nappear to have written to only 60 organisations, and did not consult\neither the Haringey Council or the Haringey Council for Voluntary\nService about other possible invitees. They appear to have made no\nreal efforts at initially inviting a great many of the Black and minority\nethnic organisations, of which there were approximately 230, even\nthough the Black and minority ethnic communities' population is\nabout 44% of the borough. According to the information which we\nhave received, only 17 such organisations were invited. Only two\nwomen's organisations were invited, even though women are among\nthe most vulnerable people in terms of criminal attacks and abuse.\nThe initial list of invitees comprised mainly neighbourhood watch\norganisations, tenants' organisations and long established groups such\nas the Church, Council of Churches, London Transport, and the\nProbation Service. There were 21 organisations present at the\nexploratory meeting, of which six appear to be minority ethnic\norganisations. The chair Eric Clarke told the Inquiry that the\nmembership is now 100, most of whom are neighbourhood watch\nschemes. Dudley Dryden, who attends the Group on behalf of the\nWest Indian Standing Conference, and is one of the very few Black\n209",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nLOOKING FORWARD: JUSTICE FROM THE LAW\npeople to attend, gave us his view of the Group at its present stage:-\n\"I do have some concern about the Consultative Group. I think the\nbase needs to be broadened for greater representation of the\npeople in Haringey, and not just as it stands at the moment, but is\nearly days and we have yet to see the base being broadened.\nOtherwise it will have a voice just in one concept only. When I am\nthere at the moment I am like a voice in the wilderness, but\nsometimes the voice in the wilderness does get results.\"\n8.43\nThe constitution as at first drafted contained as one of the nine\naims of the group:-\n\"To monitor the incidence of racial attacks and harassment in\ngeneral within Haringey and to discuss the police methods for their\nalleviation and investigation.\"\nWhen the constitution was adopted, this was amended to substitute\n\"personal violence\" for \"racial attacks.\" It must be said that the senior\npolice officers who were present supported the idea that the\nmonitoring of racial attacks should be one of the aims of the group.\nHowever, the amendment, carried by a meeting composed almost\nentirely of White people, has caused a concern about the commitment\nof the group to anti-racist policies which we find entirely reasonable.\nThis concern would not have been allayed by the passing at the next\nmeeting of a motion worded in weak and general terms that the group\n\"wishes to record their commitment that all their efforts and\nendeavours will be based on a policy of equal opportunities\nirrespective of race or sex.\"\n8.44 The Middlesex Area Probation Service, in their written\nsubmission to the Inquiry, gave this summing up of the performance\nto date of the Group which has so far been meeting:-\n\"The mood of the meeting is populist, and anger is directed\nprimarily against Haringey Council. The majority of members\npresent show little awareness of the feelings and problems\nexperienced by the young and by ethnic minorities in the borough.\nSome of the decisions taken by the Group show an unwillingness to\naccommodate the views of disadvantaged and minority groups. The\nGroup is unable to offer any constructive criticism of the police.\"\n8.45 However, the council has also a serious responsibility to bear\nfor the present situation. We have said above (3.51) that in our view\nthe council indulged in obstructive tactics when first invited to hold\n210\ndiscussions about the consultation arrangements. It deprived itself of\nthe opportunity to insist on a truly representative membership list,\nand a constitution which would be acceptable for the whole\ncommunity. With all the information at its disposal it would have been\nin a strong position to have negotiated to set up the Group on a\nconstructive basis. Its absence has encouraged the Group to become,\nas we have ourselves seen it, the anti-council gathering described by\nthe Probation Service, where any support for the council is greeted\nwith boos. At its meeting on 15th May 1986, the Group issued an\nultimatum that it would appoint council representatives itself, if the\ncouncil had not done so by the next meeting on 17th July.\n8.46 It is our firm view that this state of affairs does no service either\nto the police or to the community at this critical time. It can only be\nended if there is an open mind and a readiness to re-think on all sides.\nThe Group itself should be prepared to make a fresh start, and to\nthrow open its organisation to help every group which wishes to join.\nA public campaign to draw in members from all parts of the\ncommunity would create confidence in the Group and enable it to\nestablish wide and important links into the community. There are a\nnumber of key agencies in the borough, such as the Haringey Council\nfor Voluntary Service, the West Indian Leadership Council, the\nco-ordinating bodies for Asian and other ethnic minority and womens\norganisations, with whom the Group could co-operate in making the\ncampaign effective.\n8.47 But the re-thinking should go further than membership and\nextend to the structure of the Group and its meetings. At present it\nmeets every two months, for two hours only, unless the meeting\ndecides otherwise. A considerable portion of that time is taken up by\nreports from the two chief superintendents of Hornsey and\nTottenham. Within that framework it is not easy to see the Group\nbeing able to grapple effectively with matters of serious complaint.\nThere needs to be a readiness to meet more frequently, (the Lambeth\nConsultative Group meets twice a month) and to create sub-groups\nwhich can deal more informally and carefully with issues of particular\nconcern.\n8.48 In the longer term, the Consultative Group should have\nfunding which enables it to employ its own staff and provide\ninformation and service to its members independently of the police.\n211",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nLOOKING FORWARD: JUSTICE FROM THE LAW\nThe guidance states that costs, which are covered by the Home\nOffice, should be small. We know of at least one Consultative Group\nin London which has secured funding to cover the costs of its own\noffice and staff. The problems of Tottenham certainly deserve priority\nfor the funding of effective consultative arrangements.\n8.49 We also urge the council for its part, to enter (as a matter of\nurgency) into discussions with the group with a view to participating\nfully in its work. The council has potentially an important\nrepresentative role to play. The councillors who would most logically\nbe appointed would be the members of the police sub-committee. We\nhave heard evidence from members of that committee representing\nboth the major parties on the council. We have been informed that\nfrequently the decisions of the sub-committee are taken by a\nconsensus of both parties. If a matter of concern were brought from\nthe sub-committee on a bi-partisan basis to be raised at the\nConsultative Group, there would be powerful pressure on the police\nto deal satisfactorily with that matter of concern. Moreover the\ncouncil maintains a Police Research Unit. The information which the\nunit has gathered would be at the disposal of council representatives\non the Consultative Group, and could be used to support a demand\nfor a new policy or a request for further information.\n8.50 We questioned Councillor Grant about his attitude as leader to\nthe council's relations with the Consultative Group. His answer\ndeserves careful attention:-\n\"I think that we should take part in the Consultative Group\nproviding that the Consultative Group is representative of the\npeople in the borough. At the moment the Consultative Group is\nmade up, as I understand it, of something like 80-90% of\nneighbourhood watch schemes. There is little or no representation\nfrom Black and minority ethnic groups in the borough, of which\nthere are literally dozens. There is no representation to any great\nextent from some other community groups within the borough,\nwomen's groups and so on. I think that if the Consultative Group\nwere to become representative, then the council should take part,\neven though politically we disagree with the whole way in which it\nwas set up. I think we should concede that point and we should\ntake part, providing it's representative. Secondly, I think the\nConsultative Group will need to make a clear anti-racist statement\nand that I believe has been thrown out by the Consultative Group.\n212\nThey have refused to consider the question of racism at all within\ntheir work. As I understand it, even the police were quite happy to\nhave a reference in their objectives to an anti-racist police policy,\nfighting against racial harassment and so on. Even the police were\nquite happy with that, but the Consultative Group couldn't bring\nthemselves to agree to that particular statement. But if those two\nthings are agreed, I think we should take part in it.\"\nWe have recognised the force of both of the points made by\nCouncillor Grant in this answer. If the Consultative Group is\nunwilling to respond, then we believe that the Metropolitan Police\nwould be obliged to dissolve the present unrepresentative group and\nstart again with a wider forum.\n8.51 We emphasise, that in the interests of utilising this process of\nconsultation for the benefit of all the people of the borough, flexibility\nand restraint will be needed on both sides. The first and most\nimmediate piece of restraint will need to come from the Group at its\nnext meeting on 17th July. We believe that it must drop its\n\"ultimatum\" to the council. In the first place, the Group has no right\nwhatsoever to appoint council representatives; only the council can do\nthat. In the second place, we hope that all concerned will want to\ndigest the findings and proposals of this report, before travelling a\nstep further down the road of provocation and disunity. It may then\nbe possible for a genuine and constructive dialogue to begin.\nTHE PREVENTION OF DISORDER\n8.52 On 7th October 1985, the Commissioner of Police Sir Kenneth\nNewman made the following statement in relation to the decision not\nto use plastic bullets the night before:-\n\"But I wish to put all the people of London on notice that I will not\nshrink from such a decision should I believe it a practical option for\nrestoring peace and preventing crime and injury. I would have\nhoped not to have had to express that thought but yesterday\nevening's events have made it a regrettable possibility.\"\nThis was a chilling threat. We are sure that Sir Kenneth was keenly\naware of the anger of his own men at the experiences of 6th October.\nHe had himself visited the scene in the middle of the night. He may\nhave felt the need to give them reassurance that they would not be left\nunprotected. Even so, the words in our view would have been better.\nleft unsaid, for they increased public perception of a police force\nconcerned only to subdue disorder with even greater force. We urge\n213",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nLOOKING FORWARD: JUSTICE FROM THE LAW\nthe Commissioner to take no further steps to make that threat a\nreality. We agree with the statement which was made to us by Dudley\nDryden of the West Indian Standing Conference: -\n\"I would like to say something about the presence of plastic bullets,\nwater cannons and CS gas. They are not going to be a solution to\nthe problems. Because if a person is cornered they definitely intend\nto fight back and fight back in a very vicious and ferocious way.\nExamples over the years and hundreds of years tell us that to put\nmore pressure on persons who have already been pressurised, that\nis not the solution. The solution to the problem is to get around the\ntable in an amicable way with the community and have the matter\nbeing sorted out.\"\n8.53 Since October 1985, the Metropolitan Police have introduced\nLondoners to \"Riot City\" - a mock-up of an urban area where police\nofficers simulate riot conditions and throw petrol bombs and missiles\nat each other. It appears that all police officers are to undergo training\nthere. We find it frightening that police officers are being put through\ntraining for urban warfare without any concentrated effort being made\nto give them training also in the understanding of and conciliation in,\nurban conflicts. It is said that plastic bullets would be introduced only\nas weapons of last resort, but the experience of Northern Ireland has\nshown that they can rapidly become used as a standard way of\ndispersing a hostile crowd. Two members of our panel have had\neye-witness experience in Northern Ireland of police officers firing\nbaton rounds at bystanders who were jeering at them, before any\nhostile move had been made, provoking the very violence which they\nwere intending to deter. The Northern Ireland experience also tells us\nthat plastic bullets can and do kill innocent bystanders. We therefore\noppose any use of plastic bullets. The more that such weapons are\navailable and are used, the more an attitude of mind develops, both\namong police and other people, that it is necessary for sections of the\ncommunity to be at war with each other, with one section - the police\n- being armed as if to put down an enemy.\nPOLICE COMPLAINTS\n8.54 We have stated in paragraphs 4.52 to 4.54 our belief that the\nPolice Complaints Authority failed lamentably in its investigation of\nMrs Jarrett's death to satify a large section of the public, including\nourselves, of its independence and impartiality. What is striking about\nthe investigation is that the responsibility for that failure must be laid\n214\nsquarely at the feet of the Authority itself and not of the investigating\nofficers. We know from the evidence given to the jury, essentially\nwhat it was that the investigating officers discovered. On the basis of\nwhat they discovered, there was a clear case to recommend\ndisciplinary action, but the Authority took the decision not to do so.\nThus the argument which many put forward that complaints against\nthe police must be investigated by an independent body would not\nhave affected this case. If the Police Complaints Authority had had\nthe power to investigate the case themselves, instead of merely\nsupervising the investigation, it is likely that they would have come to\nthe same conclusion. The problem is that the members of the\nAuthority, although lay people, appear to have no idea of what\nstandards of conduct are expected by reasonable members of the\npublic. They expect that a police officer conducting a search who so\ncarelessly pushes past a woman standing peacefully in a doorway of\nher house, that she falls and dies, will be disciplined.\n8.55 We believe that it would be better for there to be a completely\nindependent authority for the investigation of complaints against the\npolice. However, the Police Complaints Authority is a newly\nestablished body and we have to consider the future on the basis that\nit will remain. In the case of Mrs Jarrett's death it could have fulfilled\nthe valuable function of insisting that disciplinary action was taken. It\nwould then have been appropriate for the Commissioner as the\ndisciplining authority, to have satisfied the public that he was\ncommitted to dealing with police misconduct. As it was, the\nAuthority, who knew that there had been intense concern and anger\nexpressed about Mrs Jarrett's death, exonerated the officers\ncompletely. They have seriously lost credibility and public confidence.\nHaving failed to act on this complaint, one wonders what trust can be\nplaced in them by others whose complaints are less publicised. The\ncase of Mrs Jarrett's death in our view calls into question whether the\nmembers of the Authority who were party to the decision should\ncontinue to hold their responsible public office.\nPOLICE INVESTIGATIONS\n8.56 We have raised in Chapter 6 a number of questions about the\nfairness and the legality of many aspects of the investigation which\nbegan after 6th October. Although the new law was not in force, that\ninvestigation tells us a lot about how the powers under the new law\nwill be used. For example, we saw how the police on a number of\n215",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nLOOKING FORWARD: JUSTICE FROM THE LAW\noccasions applied to the Magistrates Court for a remand in police\ncustody for three days, and how in the great majority of cases, those\napplications were granted. The new law allows detention for up to 96\nhours provided that a Magistrates Court grants a warrant of further\ndetention after 36 hours. We fear that it will become customary for\nmagistrates to grant such warrants in cases such as this, and we\naddress a particular appeal to the magistrates below.\n8.57 We have seen also how blatantly the police acted to deny a\nperson being interrogated, the right to have the assistance of a lawyer.\nIt was intended that under the new law the right to the assistance of a\nlawyer was automatic from the outset, except in the very exceptional\ncase where it was feared that the lawyer might pass a message\n(perhaps inadvertently) which would alert other suspects or harm\nother people. We fear that the exception under the new law will\nbecome used in as standard a way as that under the old. We believe\nthat the right of an arrested person to consult with the lawyer of his or\nher choice is fundamental. If police officers refuse to respect that\nright, which is now enshrined in law subject to an exception which\nwould occur rarely, then it is imperative that the courts protect it.\nClear rulings are needed from the courts that a \"confession\" made\nafter the wrongful refusal of access to a lawyer, will not be admitted in\nevidence.\n8.58 As far as other abuses are concerned, such as oppressive\nquestioning, intimidation, and threats, the new law provides that if a\nconfession has been obtained by the oppression of the person who\nmade it, or in consequence of anything said or done which was likely\nto render the confession unreliable, the court shall not allow the\nconfession to be given in evidence. The difficulty with that, is that the\njudges who make such decisions are inclined to believe the police\nofficer rather than the suspect when there is a conflict of evidence as\nto what was done. It is difficult to devise any set of safeguards which\nwould be guaranteed to provide redress in every case of improper\nbehaviour. But there is one obvious protection against abuse which\nshould be obligatory in a technological age the introduction of\nvideo recordings of police interviews. We find it to be something of a\nperversion of priorities that whereas sophisticated technology is\navailable to the police for them to store and retrieve vast quantities of\ninformation on computer, the simple device of a tape recorder has not\nbeen installed except as an experiment in a few police stations.\n216\n8.59 There is another scheme which is already in operation in three\nparts of London, the introduction of \"lay visitors\", i.e. lay people who\nhave the right (recognised by the police) to be admitted to any part of\na police station at any time of day or night, without prior notice, in\norder to inquire whether suspects are being properly treated. We note\nthat in the Report of the Commissioner of Police for 1985 it is stated.\nthat:-\n\"At the time of the street disorders in Lambeth the lay visitors were\nimmediately on hand to examine the way in which those arrested\nwere being dealt with.\"\nIt would have been of crucial assistance to some of the people who\nwere in custody for days, in the months following 6th October, for lay\nvisitors to have entered all the police stations where they were being\nheld in order to report on what was happening to them.\n8.60 Such a scheme would be a considerable improvement upon the\nexisting liaison officer scheme operated by the Haringey Council for\nCommunity Relations. That is a scheme whereby members of a panel\nof liaison officers maintained by the H.C.R.C. visit police stations if\nthey are invited to do so either by a police officer or by a detained\nperson, in order to defuse tense situations and ensure proper\ntreatment. The scheme may well have had valuable results when it\nwas first launched in 1974, but it has fallen into virtual disuse. We\nwere told that it was only used about twice a month, and was not\nmade use of by anybody during the period of the interrogation of\npersons detained after 6th October. The natural body to administer a\nlay visitors' scheme would be the Community and Police Consultative\nGroup - if the group was operating effectively as a representative of\nsections of the Haringey community. Certainly, such a scheme could\nonly operate if the lay visitors were fearlessly independent people who\nwere prepared to complain to the highest quarters if they came across\nabuses. It could be one of the priorities of a reconstituted and fully\nrepresentative consultative group to set up a sub-committee to work\nwith the police in the setting up of an acceptable scheme for\nHaringey.\n8.61 Separate from the question of the treatment of detained\npeople, is the question of how their relatives and friends are treated\nwhen they inquire about their welfare. Whatever the arguments about\nthe rights of people who are being questioned, it is totally\nunacceptable to be disrespectful to their relatives and to deny them\n217",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nLOOKING FORWARD: JUSTICE FROM THE LAW\ninformation. As a matter of common humanity it should be\nappreciated that the anxiety of relatives, particularly over the\ndetention of juveniles and young adults, will be acute. There should\nbe standard procedures whereby relatives who telephone or visit the\npolice station can be given accurate information about what is\nhappening. Failure to observe those procedures should be a matter of\nmisconduct. Here again the introduction of a lay visitor scheme would\nbe of value.\nCOURTS OF LAW\n8.62 If the rights of the individual are abused by the police, the only\nrecourse available is to complain to the courts of law. However we\nhave not heard of any case during the course of the investigation after\n6th October in which the court intervened effectively to curb the\nabuses about which complaints were being made. Indeed we have\nrecorded (paragraph 6.29) one occasion on which a high court judge\nwashed his hands of the matter of complaint and claimed that he had\nno jurisdiction. We would appeal to magistrates and judges to\nrecognise that they are expected by the public to be impartial arbiters\nbetween the police and the accused, who appear before them as\ninnocent persons because they have not been proved guilty.\nMagistrates do have powers which they can exercise if it is reported to\nthem that the police have used oppressive methods. They have the\npower to refuse to issue warrants of further detention under the new\nlaw; and to refuse to allow applications for remands in police custody.\nIf magistrates supinely acquiesce in whatever the police require, then\nthe courts of justice as well as the police become the objects of\ncynicism and disrepute.\n8.63 We find the use of the power to remand a defendant into police\ncustody to be particularly sinister. Normally, if bail is refused, the\ndefendant is remanded in custody to a prison, where police officers\nhave no right to enter and question him or her without consent. When\nthe remand is into police custody, the defendant remains in the police\nstation and will be questioned at any time. Therefore, a remand into\npolice custody authorises a further period of detention for questioning\nover and above the limits which Parliament has laid down. We believe\nthat this law should be changed in the light of the Broadwater Farm\nexperience, so that such remands could only be ordered in cases\nwhere the defendant agrees (as is sometimes the case when a person is\ngiving information to the police about other accomplices). So long as\n218\nthe present law remains, we urge magistrates not to allow such\nremands when they are objected to by the defence.\n8.64 The need for vigilance in the defence of civil rights, extends\nalso to members of the legal profession. They have the power - by the\narguments they raise in court, by alerting the press to attend the\npublic courts, and by making statements where necessary out of court\n- to ensure that violations of their clients' rights do not go unnoticed.\nIf just and proper redress cannot be obtained from the courts, then\nthe responsibility lies with the lawyers, who understand what legal\nprinciples are being breached, to alert the public to the injustice of the\ncase.\n8.65 The other judicial proceeding with which we have been\nconcerned has been the Coroner's Court. We have stated in Chapter 4\nthat the inquest into the death of Mrs Jarrett was conducted with\nexemplary fairness. However there are two potential sources of\ninjustice relating to Coroner's Courts which must be rectified. First, in\nan age in which the right to legal aid for representation in serious\ncases has been accepted, it is a scandalous anomaly that no legal aid is\navailable to the relatives of the deceased to be represented at an\ninquest. As we have stated above, the Jarrett family were fortunate in\nhaving able barristers and solicitor to represent them without a fee.\nSecondly, there is no good reason why the rules should preclude the\nlegal representatives of the interested parties from directly addressing\nthe jury about the verdict which they wish the jury to bring in. It is a\nbasic rule of natural justice that the case of every affected party\nshould be heard. The fact that the Coroner's inquest has some of the\nfeatures of an inquisitorial procedure is no reason for denying that\nright.\nEDUCATION IN LEGAL RIGHTS\n8.66 All the proposals made in this Chapter have been concerned to\nensure that the basic rights of the citizen under the law can be\nprotected from abuse by the agencies of the law. It is far easier for\nthose abuses to occur if citizens are ignorant of what their legal rights\nare. In Britain there is no written constitution or bill of rights which\nsets out fundamental rights in a way which can be easily understood.\nThe extent of individual rights and the extent of police powers can\nonly be understood by reference to a complicated body of statutory\nand judge-made law. Accordingly we see, as have some of the\n219",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nwitnesses to our Inquiry, a real value in introducing into the\nsecondary education system (as an obligatory part of the curriculum) a\ncourse of education in legal rights and police powers. The course\ncould be extended to include law and politics, so as to cover elections\nand political parties, central and local government, as well as legal\nrights and the powers of the police. These are topics which at present\noccur only incidentally (for instance in social studies courses) in the\nnormal school curriculum. If they were compulsory, they would\ninform not only those who will have to deal with the police, but also\nfuture police officers, of their rights and duties under the law.\n220\nChapter Nine\nLOOKING FORWARD – BUILDING A\n-\nSELF RELIANT COMMUNITY\n9.1 In Chapter 2 we traced the decline and revival of Broadwater\nFarm. We decribed a community of people who succeeded, in co-\noperation with the council and other agencies, in improving their\nliving environment against all the odds. In paragraph 3.53 we spoke of\nthe optimism which showed through the headlines of the Youth\nAssociation magazine in June 1985. In the 12 months since then, the\ndisturbances and their consequences have over-shadowed the success.\nBut the council and other agencies which supported Broadwater Farm\nin the past have not changed their attitudes to the estate. On the\ncontrary, they favour new projects to the extent that resources allow.\nAnd the people of Broadwater Farm, in evidence to us and in answer\nto our survey, have been stressing the problems and making proposals\nfor dealing with them.\n9.2 We believe that the achievements of Broadwater Farm in recent\nyears must be extended and developed. The self-reliant spirit of the\nYouth Association and other organisations cannot be guaranteed to\ncontinue whatever the circumstances. It is vulnerable to a\ncombination of factors - lack of resources, police action, the despair\nof community leaders, the apathy of residents. If it were crushed\nentirely the social consequences would be grave. We do not make a\nsimplistic link between deprivation and rioting, for the cost of\nunemployment and poverty can be paid in many other ways. But\nthere is a connection: as Ernie Large said:-\n\"If you take unemployment and poverty and top them up with\noppression, you are likely to light a fuse, and that goes for any\ncommunity anywhere in the world, if you add those ingredients\ntogether. And that is what is perceived to have been happening\nwith the Black community in Tottenham.\"\n221"

In paragraph 3.53 we spoke of\nthe optimism which showed through the headlines of the Youth\nAssociation magazine in June 1985. In the 12 months since then, the\ndisturbances and their consequences have over-shadowed the success.\nBut the council and other agencies which supported Broadwater Farm\nin the past have not changed their attitudes to the estate. On the\ncontrary, they favour new projects to the extent that resources allow.\nAnd the people of Broadwater Farm, in evidence to us and in answer\nto our survey, have been stressing the problems and making proposals\nfor dealing with them.\n9.2 We believe that the achievements of Broadwater Farm in recent\nyears must be extended and developed. The self-reliant spirit of the\nYouth Association and other organisations cannot be guaranteed to\ncontinue whatever the circumstances. It is vulnerable to a\ncombination of factors - lack of resources, police action, the despair\nof community leaders, the apathy of residents. If it were crushed\nentirely the social consequences would be grave. We do not make a\nsimplistic link between deprivation and rioting, for the cost of\nunemployment and poverty can be paid in many other ways. But\nthere is a connection: as Ernie Large said:-\n\"If you take unemployment and poverty and top them up with\noppression, you are likely to light a fuse, and that goes for any\ncommunity anywhere in the world, if you add those ingredients\ntogether. And that is what is perceived to have been happening\nwith the Black community in Tottenham.\"\n221",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nLOOKING FORWARD: (2) BUILDING A SELF RELIANT COMMUNITY\n9.3 In concentrating on Broadwater Farm and its immediate\nneighbourhood we in no way intend to imply that it should have\nspecial treatment over and above other neighbourhoods in Haringey\nor elsewhere which have similar needs. There are ways in which\nBroadwater Farm is exceptional. Its organisations have proved\nthemselves able to make maximum use of the resources which were\navailable. Its organisations have been led principally by Black people\nand have earned the support of the vast majority of residents, Black\nand White. These are considerable achievements, but in directing our\nproposals to Broadwater Farm we do not wish to exclude other areas.\nOn the contrary we believe that much of what we propose would also\nhave beneficial effects if applied to other areas of high unemployment\nand poor facilities.\n9.4 Apart from the need for co-operative policing, the needs which\nhave been voiced to our Inquiry can be summarised under five\nheadings:\n9.5\n1. Resources and support from central government.\n2. Investment and support for projects which will generate\nemployment.\n3. Continued development of community facilities.\n4. Better education for children and adults.\n5. Fair reporting in the media and an end to the undesirable label\nput on the estate by other agencies.\nWe stress that in this chapter we do not provide a complete\nblueprint for action in these fields, but rather a number of sign posts\nto further discussion, in which we hope the people of Haringey\ngenerally, and of Broadwater Farm in particular, will be involved.\nIndeed the common thread of the topics covered in this chapter is that\nthose who have power to make decisions affecting a community of\npeople must consult with them, listen to them, learn from them, and\nmodify their preconceptions accordingly. We ourselves have gone\nthrough this process. The experience of this Inquiry has confirmed for\nus that people addressing serious problems have experiences and ideas\nwhich those with any influence must treat with serious attention.\nDolly Kiffin illustrated the point vividly for us with the aid of the\ncarafe of water and plastic cup on the table beside her: -\n222\n\"They must not come down to any community and just say, I am\ngoing to give you this bottle. Because the people might not want\nthe bottle, they want this cup. They should be able to ask the\npeople, what do they want? and then the people tell them that they\nwant the cup.\"\nTHE ROLE OF CENTRAL GOVERNMENT\n9.6 Different government departments have developed very\ndifferent approaches to the Broadwater Farm Estate. We have noted\nearlier on the important work of the Priority Estates Project in not\nonly helping to develop community organisations but also ensuring\nthat those organisations have a voice in the Department of the\nEnvironment. We have also noted the personal interest which Sir\nGeorge Young, Minister of State at the Department of the\nEnvironment, has shown in the successful innovations in housing\nmanagement on the estate. On the other hand the Home Secretary\nseems to have taken very little interest in the estate as a community of\nresidents when he visited police units around the estate in March\n1986.\n9.7 But the major impact of central government on housing and\nother local authority services has been caused by government policies\non public expenditure - in particular, rate support grant penalties and\nrate capping. The amount of government contribution to Haringey's\nexpenditure which has been cut back through the operation of these\npolicies since 1979 has been massive. It has inevitably had an effect\nupon both the physical fabric of Broadwater Farm and the facilities\navailable for the community. We have noted that the Department of\nthe Environment in 1980 concluded that it would probably be\nnecessary for the estate to be blown up. We believe along with Tricia\nZipfel that the fact that it was not blown up is mainly a vindication of\nthe community organisations on the estate. However the cut-backs\nreveal a striking inconsistency: the Department of the Environment's\ncontrols on spending were contributing to the very decline which the\nsame Department's Priority Estates Programme was working to avoid.\nWe believe, therefore, that there must be a considerable increase in\nthe investment of public money in the areas of greatest deprivation\nand that this must be effected through the elected local authority\n223",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nrather than through a number of unrepresentative bodies.\na\n9.8 There has been one specific and important anomaly in\ngovernment expenditure which has affected Haringey in\ndiscriminatory way. This concerns the status of the borough within the\nUrban Programme. Different local authorities have a different status\nwithin this programme, which means that they can claim a greater or\nlesser amount of government grants. The most favoured status is\nPartnership status, accorded to three London Boroughs, and after\nthat Programme status, accorded to four London Boroughs.\nHaringey, although the sixth most deprived borough according to the\nDepartment of the Environment's own indicators (colloquially known.\nas the \"misery league\"), has not been accorded either Partnership or\nProgramme status. The achievement of Programme status would bring\nsomething between four and five million pounds into the deprived\nareas of Haringey in urban programme grants. The council's finance\nofficer said in evidence to us about the rejection of Haringey's\nrepresentations: --\n\"It is very difficult to understand why, because we feel that a strong\ncase has been made. On the DOE's own measures of deprivation\nHaringey is rather more deprived that a number of authorities\nwhich do have Programme status.\"\nWe urge the Government to recognise the needs of the people of\nHaringey; and to grant Programme status to Haringey without delay.\n9.9 There have also been inconsistencies in the way in which finance\nis distributed from central government. Recently, in June 1986, an\napplication made by Haringey to the Department of the\nEnvironment's Urban Housing Renewal Unit was granted. As part of\nthis application around half a million pounds has been allocated for\nhousing improvement on the Broadwater Farm Estate. We welcome\nthis significant input of financial resources. But the half million\npounds has to be spent within the current financial year. This means\nthat the building design team, which is now based on the estate for the\npurpose of listening to the ideas of local people, do not have time to\ncarry out effective consultations about how the money should be\nspent. The borough is faced with the choice of either failing to spend.\nmuch needed resources, or spending them without proper\nconsultation. John Murray, of the council's Building Design Service,\nexplained the problem in terms with which we agree-\n\"We must have economic planning over about three years. Even\n224\nLOOKING FORWARD: (2) BUILDING A SELF RELIANT COMMUNITY\nthe District Auditor had said that it is impossible for councils to\nplan in this way. It is obviously impossible on Broadwater Farm for\nmus to do it sensibly because decisions are rushed, and foolish\ndecisions are made, but rather than lose the money people will\nWattempt to spend it.\"\n9.10 Another area of direct impact of government policy concerns\nthe funds available for spending by local authorities on economic\ndevelopment schemes. The only effective legal power possessed by\nlocal authorities for investment in business or co-operative enterprises\nis that given by Section 137 of the Local Government Act 1972 to\nspend amounts up to the product of a 2p rate in the pound on any\nprojects which are considered beneficial to the borough and which are\nnot otherwise authorised. Valuable use of this power has already been\nmade to fund co-operatives on Broadwater Farm. But there are too.\nmany calls on the limited funds allowed by law. Haringey along with\nmany other authorities in London has called on the government to\ndouble the amount which the council could spend on economic\ndevelopment schemes under this power, and we agree. Given the\ncrushing unemployment which we consider below, it must be sensible\nfor local authorities to have the greatest possible discretion to\nprioritise employment-generating schemes.\n9.11 We emphasise that our ability to consider detailed overall\npolicies for central government towards urban priority areas has been\nlimited both by time and by the locally based nature of our Inquiry.\nThe ideas discussed in the preceeding paragraphs are those which\nwould have the most direct impact upon Broadwater Farm, but they\nare not comprehensive. The report of the Archbishop of Canterbury's\nCommission on Urban Priority Areas (Faith in the City) has made a\nmore thorough examination of policies for such areas, and we broadly\nagree with its conclusions and recommendations.\nTHE CREATION OF JOBS\n9.12 Being unemployed within British society is an experience of\npersonal humiliation and social isolation. Even if many friends and\nrelatives are also out of work, there are powerful social forces which\nunderline the insecurity of being without a job. For the people of\nBroadwater Farm, household incomes are very low. 69% of the adults.\nin our survey were without full time employment. Whilst for young\nWhite men aged 16-24, only 47% were unemployed, some 83% of\n225",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nyoung Black men were. 94% of the adults see unemployment as a big\nproblem. Many residents both young and old talked of the appalling\neffect of being without a job on the young people of the estate. We do\nnot have to prove that unemployment has a disastrous effect on\npeople's lives, nor that there is a growing lack of employment\nopportunities in the Broadwater Farm area. But while few people on\nBroadwater Farm have jobs, many would readily respond to a worth-\nwhile job. Adeyemi Hinds, development worker with the Broadwater\nFarm Youth Association Co-operative, described the position:-\n\"The situation here is that there is a lot of bored people about, but\nat the same time there is a tremendous enthusiasm for getting\nthings done, or to actually do something.\"\n9.13 The people of the estate have demonstrated their ability to\nwork hard at community regeneration. We are sure that they want to\nwork hard also at the provision of employment opportunities. But just\nas we have seen the necessity of external intervention and assistance\nin other areas, the same is true of economic regeneration. As we show\nin paragraph 7.12 the residents of the estate possess minimal\nresources, hardly sufficient to enable them to purchase bare\nessentials, let alone provide the base for new initiatives and jobs. The\nestate needs external resources linked to internal initiatives and\nlabour, to enable economic regeneration to take place. Leonardo\nLeon, treasurer of the Residents' Association, described how the\npotential was there to be tapped:-\n\"This place is a very effective work place. You have many problems\nhere, but what struck me when I came is you also see people with a\nwill to change things. What ever we do here could be a test case, a\nshowpiece for the country and for our communities.\"\n9.14 The major loss of jobs in recent years has come from the\nreduction in the size of the manufacturing sector. Given the nature of\nemployment in Haringey (some 44% of employed Haringey residents\nare employed outside the borough) it is necessary to look at the\nLondon economy as a whole. Some 534,000 manufacturing jobs were\nlost in London between 1971 and 1981. Within Haringey we know\nthat the decline in industry is twice that of Brent, and unemployment\nwas the highest in any borough in outer London in January 1986. In\n1981 the Department of Employment's Labour Force Survey found\nthat Black workers were in general concentrated in manufacturing\n226\nLOOKING FORWARD: (2) BUILDING A SELF RELIANT COMMUNITY\nindustries as opposed to other sectors: 27% of West Indian men\ncompare to only 12% of White men worked in that sector.\nConsequently the contraction of the manufacturing sector has hit\nHaringey harder than other boroughs, and Black people harder than\nWhite.\n9.15 It would be useless for this Inquiry to recommend that private\nenterprise should re-invest in the Haringey area in defiance of the\nlogic of profits. National and international competition has under-\nmined the economy base of London. However, local government can\nhave an effect upon local private sector employment. Local\nauthorities contract for a great many goods and services, and are in a\nposition to insist that companies with whom they contract employ\nlocal labour. This would represent an extension of the practice of\ncontract compliance; that is to insert conditions in contracts to require\ncontracting companies to adopt policies for equal opportunities and\ngood race relations. Positive action imposed by the power of the\npublic purse could encourage private corporations to take a more\nresponsible attitude to both local and ethnic employment. To be fully\neffective this proposal would need changes in the legislation which\nrequires competitive tendering, but even within the existing law there\nare ways of persuading private companies to employ local labour, as\nLeonardo Leon told us:-\n\"We have been working on the idea of building workshops under\nsome of the blocks. Now we got some building companies coming\nto us, and I remember in one meeting they put plans to us, and a\nyouth there said 'all right, how many people are you prepared to\nemploy from the estate on the project?' And they said, because\nthey wanted to get the tender, 'we are prepared to employ anyone.\"\nAnd he said \"But how many will be working as assistants to the\narchitects, not just bricklayers and painters? How many people are\nyou prepared to train for two or three weeks, so they can learn a\nproper job, be more professional?' and they were surprised and\nthey said 'we will consider it'.\"\nThis example shows the power of dialogue with local people. If the\nidea is being discussed at that meeting were implemented, it would be\nto the benefit both of the private employer and of people of the\nestate.\n9.16 The largest employers of labour in Haringey and in London\ngenerally are in the public sector. It is impossible to construct any\n227",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nplan for employment without taking that sector into account. The\nLondon Borough of Haringey has continued to increase employment\nopportunities throughout the past six years: but we question the\nextent to which these opportunities have been available to ethnic\nminority applicants.\n9.17 As they have been keeping and maintaining ethnic records of\ntheir workforce for some time, we would expect that they would be\ntaking the necessary positive actions that would ensure a more\nequitable distribution of employment opportunities.\n9.18 We turn next to the field of small businesses and co-operatives,\nwhich as a form of employment regeneration has considerable support\nfrom the residents of Broadwater Farm. People see running their own\nbusiness or playing a part in a co-operative as not only providing a job\nbut giving some element of control over their work. Over the past few\nyears there have been a number of co-operative enterprises started on\nBroadwater Farm with support from the council's Economic\nDevelopment Unit. Grants have been made to the Launderette\n(£44,187 plus £2,500 loan); the Photographic project (£39,000); and\nthe Youth Association for the development of the co-operative\n(£25,880 plus £3000 loan). Such grants were of great significance in\nenabling projects to be launched. But limited as they were by the\nconstraints of Section 137 (see paragraph 9.10) they can only be a\nsmall part of the solution to the estate's investment needs. We have\nreceived criticisms of the Economic Development Unit to the effect\nthat they are unnecessarily bureaucratic in their operation. We\nlearned also from the evidence of the Economic Development Unit's\nofficers that they have in 1985/86 fully achieved their target of\nallocating 40% of available funds to enterprises run by Black and\nminority ethnic people. We urge the council to continue this priority,\nand to continue to fund enterprises on the estate to the limit.\n316\n9.19 However, the role of a local authority is necessarily limited.\nThe problem in this field is the provision of finance capital to provide\na base for economic development. Traditional sources of finance have\nfailed to provide such a base. Banks and other private financial\ninstitutions claim that the business enterprises put forward are not\nones which can guarantee a return for their depositors. Accordingly\nthe initiatives have been left to public agencies and the results so far\nachieved have been minimal in comparison to the scale of the\nproblem.\n228\nLOOKING FORWARD: (2) BUILDING A SELF RELIANT COMMUNITY\n9.20 Because of the overwhelming importance of economic\nregeneration, we decided to commission a study from the consultancy\nfirm Equinox into the possibilities for the development of small\nbusinesses and co-operatives on the estate. Their report merits\ndetailed study by all involved in the consideration of this question.\nThey identified the principal elements which are necessary for\nenterprise development as being:-\n1. The availability of willing entrepreneurs; the report traces the\npattern of discrimination against Black entrepreneurs, and\ndescribes the various structural forms which a business can adopt.\n2. The need for profitability and a sufficient market.\n3. The need for adequate capital and credit; the report identifies\nthe various schemes operated by central and local government to\nprovide loans or guarantees for businesses which would find\ndifficulties in raising capital on the private market.\n4. The need for management and technical expertise: the report\ncriticises the lack of hard business know-how in the economic\ndevelopment units of local authorities which try to give advice in\nthis field.\nThe report also identifies a certain possible business project which\nwe discuss below.\n9.21 The agency which has recently been set up on Broadwater\nFarm to promote economic development is the Broadwater Farm\nYouth Association Co-op Limited. The ways in which the co-\noperative will participate in particular economic projects is still under\ndiscussion, and the Equinox report offers a number of possible\nstructures. It seems to us that two initiatives - one already under\nway, the other only in the planning stage - are central to the capacity\nof the co-operative to promote significant economic regeneration.\nFirst the co-operative is in the course of carrying out a skills survey on\nthe estate. This will give two important sets of information. First, the\nskills which people living on the estate possess will be known. In\neconomic terms we will know the full extent that labour power on the\nestate can be used to create wealth. Secondly, the survey will reveal\nthe numbers of people on the estate who not only want to develop\ntheir skills working for other people, but who also want to act as\nentrepreneurs themselves. Both sets of information, which are not yet\ngathered in a form that we can take account of, will be of great\nassistance in making economic plans for the estate.\n229",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\n9.22 The other necessary foundation for development would be the\nestablishment of a financial holding company as a part of the co-\noperative. The co-operative has a wealth of possible ventures for the\ncommunity, but it lacks finance and technical back-up. The lack of\ncapital is the most pressing problem. To obtain that capital the\nco-operative will need an organisational base, together with a high\nlevel of financial skills. In the United States there are examples of\nresponsible finance capital and other organisations assisting inner city\ngroups to develop by providing their skills without charge. We believe\nthat the same could be true in Britain, given a similar commitment to\nsocial responsibility by financial institutions.\n9.23 There is space on the estate for the physical location of small\nbusinesses. The council has put forward a plan for building a number\nof workshops under the walkways along Willan Road. Because of the\nconstruction of the estate, there is space for such workshops without\ninterfering with the residential amenities. The Department of the\nEnvironment is presently determining whether to support this plan:\nwe would commend it strongly as a most appropriate use of space and\nas an essential prerequisite to the generation of employment.\n9.24 A further element in the back-up needed would be a specially\ndesigned training programme. Since the estate will have a full analysis\nof available and potential skills, together with several possible\nmarketable ideas, the necessary training programme for managerial\nand craft skills should be easy to construct. Many of these\nprogrammes should be carried out on the estate itself. The workshops\ncould also provide a base for training. We would hope that the two\nfurther education colleges run by Haringey and the two local\npolytechnics in Middlesex and North London would be able to\nprovide staff time in this venture. All four institutions have a specific\nbrief for the involvement of the community in further and higher\neducation. Broadwater Farm, where the community has a clear view\nof what it needs, would provide a prefect opportunity to demonstrate\nthat commitment.\n9.25 Lastly, but most significantly, there are already a number of\nspecific ideas for co-operative developments on the estate. Three\nco-operatives have been formed: the launderette, the fruit and\nvegetable shop, and the hairdressing salon have all managed to\nestablish themselves at a time when many small businesses were\n230\nLOOKING FORWARD: (2) BUILDING A SELF RELIANT COMMUNITY\nstruggling to survive. There are three further organisations in\nexistence which are in the process of becoming co-operative ventures.\nFirst, the photographic project has provided a useful service to the\nestate, and could be the basis of further training. Secondly, the sewing\nand dressmaking project has established itself over several years as a\npart of the life of the estate, and is now in a position to develop an\norganisation of home workers for the machinists that live on the\nestate. Finally, the restaurant in the Youth Association already\nprovides meals for residents, and could develop a catering service for\nevents within the borough.\n9.26 For the future, there are no less than six other possible ideas\nthat have emerged in discussion between the people of the estate and\nthe consultancy firm Equinox:-\n(1). A radio station and music studio. People are not only\ninterested in listening to music or radio, but they are also very\ncapable of making it. In other areas of high unemployment, notably\nSheffield, Consett and Sunderland, recording studios have been\nbuilt; the studio in Sheffield is of the highest international standard.\nA well run studio is likely to attract artists from outside the estate\nand the borough to come in and use the facilities, using musicans\non the estate as session artists. Radio is an area where Black people\nare under-represented although they form a sizeable target\naudience. The Home Office is at this moment monitoring a scheme\nto provide very local radio licenses, and we believe that a radio\nstation would be a project that will be well received by the residents\nof the estate. A sound proofed studio would have to be built which\ncould be used for both these ventures.\n(2). A radio controlled mini-cab service. A number of people on\nthe estate own cars which could be used for the provision of a\nmini-cab service, which could be particularly viable if it obtained\ncontracts from public organisations.\n(3). A motor repair and servicing garage. Again this service could\nmake use of skills already existing on the estate. Potential\ncustomers could be drawn from large public organisations which\nown fleets of cars, such as the council. It could be expanded to\ninclude a used car supermarket.\n(4). A construction company. Construction remains one of the\nreal possibilities for the estate to develop a labour-intensive\nindustry. The area surrounding the estate has a constant demand.\nfor housing improvement. The estate itself has also continued to\n231",
            "and stream\nTHE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nneed reconstruction. All the money spent on the estate may well\nassist in improving the environment, but it does not provide local\njobs. There was particular ill feeling expressed to us about a recent\ncontract for painting the concrete pillars under the blocks which did\nnot involve any local people. A local construction company would\nchange this. The company could act as a contractor for work by the\ncouncil, although members of the co-operative are aware that\ndiscussion would have to be held with the council's direct labour\norganisation in order to secure amicable agreement about the\ndistribution of council work.\n(5). Light assembly and repair facilities in high technology. There\nis considerable interest in using one of the workshops for the\nassembly and repair of computers. A major computer company\ncould be encouraged to become involved as partners in the\ndevelopment of this idea, helping to train young people on the\nestate for careers in computer repair, which is now becoming a\ngrowth area.\n(6). A supermarket or mini-market. The shopping precinct on\nTangmere has never been fully developed as an economic unit, and\nmany of its shops are at present empty. A comprehensive shopping\ncentre would be of great value to residents on the estate, but it\nwould be unlikely to be profitable if it only sold to people on the\nestate. People would have to be attracted from outside. In terms of\ncar parking this is quite feasible; the problem is to challenge the\nreputation of Broadwater Farm as an undesirable place to visit.\n9.27 These six ideas are further discussed in the Equinox report.\nClearly a great deal of further work is necessary before any of them\ncould be put forward as a feasible project. The exact structure of such\nbusinesses needs careful thought and consultation, and we would wish\nto ensure that in the selection and development of enterprises on the\nestate there was not a dominance of participation by men to the\nexclusion of women. The ideas are imaginative, and they indicate the\ndetermination of residents to construct employment opportunities.\nBut their ideas and commitment are not enough to bring about the\nreality. Private and public enterprise, both nationally and locally,\nneed to take these hopes and projects seriously. They need help with\nfinance, expert advice, and markets. People on the estate have moved\nthis far through their own efforts; it is vital that their efforts should\nnot be ignored by those in the outside world who have the power to\nhelp.\nLOOKING FORWARD: (2) BUILDING A SELF RELIANT COMMUNITY\nTHE ESTATE AND ITS ENVIRONMENT\n9.28 Building a large council estate represents an enormous\norganisational task. It calls upon a wide range of professional and\ncraft skills. A thousand-dwelling estate like Broadwater Farm could\nonly be successfully completed in a few years, if all of these skills were\ndeployed to the highest standard. In fact, as we have noted, there\nwere physical problems resulting from design errors in the\nconstruction of the estate which have had, and continued to have, an\nimpact on the lives of the residents. However, the council in building\nthe estate built no facilities which were adequate to enable a\ncommunity of residents to develop. We have seen at Broadwater\nFarm how new residents were arriving all the time, adjusting to a new\nenvironment, nearly all of them living on an estate for the first time,\nneeding assistance and services which were not there.\n9.29 We have seen that four factors coincided to save Broadwater\nFarm from total decline. First, there were members of the local\ncommunity who were prepared to start from nothing and retain their\nhope against all the odds. Secondly, there were a number of trusted\nlocal community leaders who at crucial points were catalysts in the\norganisation of change. Thirdly, the local authority was willing to\nchange its structures and to admit great errors in its previous action.\nFourthly, there was skilful support from outside from the Priority\nEstates Project of the Department of the Environment.\n9.30 What of the future? We have seen that the majority of residents\nare still concerned about the lack of facilities on the estate. There\nremains nowhere for people to go who do not fit into the activities of\nthe Youth Association or the Mothers' Project. A proper community\ncentre is an essential next step. Funds have been allocated, and\ndiscussions about its location and design will take place with the\ndesign team of the council's Building Design Service. Sheila Ramdin,\nchair of the Residents' Association, explained her ideas for the new\ncentre:-\n\"Activities for the young, old, and middle-aged. We used to have a\nbingo session downstairs for the old age pensioners in the social\nclub. When we build this new place we want to have a place where\npeople can come with their kids and relax and have a drink. There\nshould be a place where the kids can go and play. Probably there\nwould be keep-fit, dance classes, bingo sessions again, and if people\nwanted to hire the place for private dos, they could.\"\n233\nCut into invests\ng. in USA.\n232",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nLeonardo Leon made the point that a new community centre\nshould be for the whole area, not only for the estate:-\n\"If it is ever built, I don't think we will mind if it is placed on the\nfringes of the estate. We would like ourselves to be in charge and to\nadminister it. But we are working not only for the estate but for the\nwhole area.\"\nIn this connection we were pleased to hear the evidence of Anne\nMusselwhite, who represented the Mount Pleasant Residents'\nAssociation, and who said that she and her association would be\npleased to be involved as a user of a community centre situated in an\naccessible place.\n9.31 We have received other proposals for specific amenities on and\naround the estate. There is a proposal which has already been broadly\napproved for an arts workshop in one of the Tangmere shops. Some\npeople have expressed the need for a doctor's surgery, which was\noriginally part of the design of the estate. There is a need also which\nmany people have spoken of, for a bus service to go through the\ncentre of the estate. If as we believe an adequate case in terms of\ndemand is made out, we can see no reason why London Regional\nTransport should not meet this need. Where a community of three\nthousand people have access roads running through, and the level of\ncar ownership is low, it would seem logical for a bus service to go\ndown those roads and serve that community. If LRT does not\nrespond, then a private mini bus enterprise could well be valuable on\nthe estate, travelling at regular intervals to the High Road and to\nWood Green.\n9.32 We spoke in Chapter 2 of the grave under-use of the Lordship\nRecreation Ground, which had been brought to our notice\nparticularly by the Haringey Sports Council. This is an amenity which\nmany housing estates would much desire to have on their doorstep.\nWe understand from the Community Affairs Department that they\nhave over some years proposed a major leisure and environmental\npackage for the Recreation Ground but nothing has been done, partly\nthrough lack of resources, and partly perhaps because the Recreation\nGround has not been high on the priorities of the community. But we\nfeel that with imagination and pressure from the community there\ncould be much more benefit to be derived by the people of the estate\nfrom this important open space.\n234\nLOOKING FORWARD: (2) BUILDING A SELF RELIANT COMMUNITY\n9.33 In relation to all these specific ideas it is not our business to\nspeak for the community, for they are well capable of speaking for\nthemselves. The essence of the message to be learned from the last\nfew years on Broadwater Farm is that participation of residents in all\naspects of the development of an estate is essential if acceptable and\nsuccessful decisions are to be taken. It is no good at all to have council\nestates with well organised community groups unless they can play a\nfull part in the management of the affairs of the estate. It is towards\nthis goal that a policy of full decentralisation must be aimed. The\nNeighbourhood Office and the Broadwater Farm Panel have made\nconsiderable progress to this end. People are beginning to feel that\nthey have a say. They are beginning to feel that their Neighbourhood\nOffice will represent them against the faceless council bureaucrats.\nThey have plans to develop their own expertise on the estate, and as\nwe have seen, to provide their own employment organisations. We\nwould urge the council to develop this policy of decentralisation of\npower as fully as possible. In particular the powers of the Broadwater\nFarm Panel over the disbursement of finances on the estate should be\nextended. One of central government's main arguments against\nincreasing local government expenditure is that money is in some way\nlost and does not get spent on the sort of activities that it is meant to\nbe spent on. We believe that the more local communities, in\nconjunction with their local authority representatives, can play a role\nin the expenditure of resources, then the more likely it is that they will\nbe targeted most accurately to the greatest areas of need.\n9.34 So far as the financing of community organisations themselves\nis concerned, we applaud the allocation of grants which have been\nmade in the past to the Youth Association and other bodies. As we\nhave described in Chapter 2, the funds granted have been well used.\nWe note however that some of the community groups have\ncomplained that they were given insufficient grants, in addition to\ntheir basic expenditure needs, to employ the necessary accountants to\nassist them in carrying out their tasks. We would urge all grant giving\nauthorities to make sure that as well as providing the money for\nservice expenditure they also provide sufficient top-up to allow\ncommunity groups to obtain the professional back-up for the\norganising of their accounts.\n9.35 Finally we should make some comment on the housing\nallocation policy of the council. Between 1976 and 1981 there were\n235",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nsome six separate reports put before the housing committee which\nproposed different kinds of modification to the policies for allocating\ntenancies on Broadwater Farm. There were a number of problems\ncommon to all these reports. First, they have all been unable to deal\nwith the issue of racism in housing allocation because the statistics\nbased upon ethnic monitoring of housing allocation did not exist. We\nknow from reports from other London boroughs that racism is one of\nthe important components of some housing allocation policies, and it\nseems quite possible that it is so within the London Borough of\nHaringey. But we do not know, because the important commitment to\nethnic monitoring of this system has not been carried out. Until this\nhappens with all housing statistics, it is going to be impossible for the\ncouncil adequately to implement an anti racist housing policy. We are\naware that housing officers were recommending ethnic record-keeping\nsince at least the mid 1970s, and we are surprised that nothing\neffective has yet been done. We urge the council to take this in hand\nwithout delay.\n9.36 The second common feature of allocation policy on Broadwater\nFarm is that the council in attempting to engage (as one of their\nreports stated) in social engineering, caused considerable restriction of\nchoice, and which in the event failed to achieve the desired balance.\nFor once the initial estate population has come together through the\nfirst allocation, people's choices to move onto and out of the estate\nare taken on the basis of a number of factors which the council can\nnot directly control. For example once the estate gained the\nreputation of being an unpleasant place to live, many people refused\nto move onto the estate because of that reputation. And therefore the\nestate became tenanted, particularly, by homeless people who were\ngiven no choice. To change the mix of people on the estate would\nhave required changing that reputation, which in turn would mean\ndealing with the conditions which had brought the estate a bad name.\nSince this was never taken on board, the many changes in housing\nallocation over the late 1970s and early 1980s were simply affecting\npeople at the very margin who had little choice in any case. For the\noverall pattern was that, in their anxiety to fill the voids (the empty\nflats on the estate) the council was pushing people in who had no\nchoice but to accept the offer made to them.\n9.37 These changes in allocation policy, particularly the decision to\ngive homeless people a second choice, have had some marginal effect\n236\nLOOKING FORWARD: (2) BUILDING A SELF RELIANT COMMUNITY\nupon the estate. However the real changes in the nature of the estate\nhave come about through a much more comprehensive housing policy\nrelationship between the people on the estate and the housing\nmanagement office. Quite simply, people will want to be allocated a\ntenancy in an estate which is well run, well maintained, and has good\ncommunity facilities. Housing allocation policy has to be part of a\nmuch wider housing framework. We note that housing allocation\npolicy in Haringey is being comprehensively reviewed at this moment,\nwith a discussion document being considered by tenants' associations\nand other relevant bodies. We would urge full member involvement,\nand also full consultation with organisations on the estate, in the\nallocation of housing on Broadwater Farm.\nPARTICIPATION IN EDUCATION\n9.38 The inquiry has received reports and held interviews with\nsenior staff of the Haringey College, the Tottenham Technical\nCollege, The Adult Education Institute, and a number of primary and\nsecondary schools including all the schools on the estate, as well as\nreceiving written and oral evidence from the council's Education\nService. The material which we have received suggests that many\nschool leavers and older youth on the Broadwater Farm estate are\nresentful of formal education and schooling, because of their past\nschool experiences. The education system has failed young Black\npeople in particular. Teachers with whom we spoke considered that\nwhile Black pupils were as intelligent and creative as White pupils,\nmany left school with poor literacy in written English, and with little.\nunderstanding of the formal techiques and application of scientific\nknowledge. The potential which many people possessed was not\ndeveloped by the schools that they attended nor by further education\nwhere there is a lower than average take-up compared with other\nareas.\n9.39 There was a report published in 1984 by HM Inspectors on\nEducational provision and response in some Haringey schools, which\npresented a \"rather depressing picture\". They noted a higher than\naverage incidence of non-attendance; disruptive and unacceptable\nbehaviour; and undemanding work. They found that careers\neducation was generally underdeveloped, and the transfer rate to\nfurther education was lower than in other authorities. Examination\nresults in GCE 'O' Level and CSE were disappointing. Their overall\nconclusion was that \"with a few notable exceptions, the quality of the\n237",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\neducation being received by older junior and secondary pupils ranged\nfrom mediocre to poor\". The picture was particular gloomy for Black\npupils. A local Black Pressure Group on Education was formed in\n1975 because, in the words of the group, \"a lot of us saw that the\neducation system in Haringey was not catering for the Black children\nthat are born here\".\n9.40 We have not been able to study the education system in\nHaringey in such depth as to be able to offer a comprehensive\nprogramme for tackling the serious problems that exist. However, we\nhave no doubt that for Haringey's Education Service there is an\nurgent need for actions which will make a reality of the council's firm\nanti-racist position. These actions should include: a thorough scrutiny\nof the curriculum to eradicate racist bias from school studies and\npromote an anti racist and a multi-cultural approach (making full use\nof the resources of the Multi-Curriculum Resource Unit); in-service.\ntraining of teachers in countering racism; and a commitment to\npostive action to recruit Black people as teachers and other staff at all\nlevels.\n9.41 It was accepted by the education service in their evidence to us\nthat there were few Black teachers in Haringey schools in proportion\nto the numbers of Black people in Haringey. The exact position is\nimpossible to state because of the failure of the Education Service to\ncarry through a policy of ethnic monitoring of teachers. In the context\nof Broadwater Farm, this under-representation was plainly apparent\nto us. In the junior and infant schools adjacent to the estate there\nwere no Black teaching staff before October 1985. Councillor Martha\nOsamor, who became chair of the schools sub-committee in May\n1986, spoke strongly on this issue:-\n\"The need for us to have in schools, teachers that represent the\ncommunity of that particular school becomes very, very crucial.\nBecause if we don't, our young people will grow up and come out\nwith nothing. Not coming out with a proper education, but also\ncoming out confused. So what I personally hope to see within the\nschool is for us to see a radical change within the structure, being\nfrom the nursery upwards.\n9.42 We also believe that the education service must take planned.\ninitiatives to go out to community organisations and involve people in\nconsultation and discussion about the service which is being provided.\n238\nLOOKING FORWARD: (2) BUILDING A SELF RELIANT COMMUNITY\nWe doubt whether the existing parent teacher structures are adequate\nfor this purpose. People on Broadwater Farm have felt that the\narrangements for consultation and public participation, which have\nbeen so successfully adopted in the Housing Management field, have\nnot been attempted in the field of education. For example, at the local\nlevel, personnel involved in education services which are relevent to\nthe estate should be represented at inter-agency meetings and at the\nBroadwater Farm Panel meeting. There they could discuss the\nproblems with many community representatives who include not only\nparents but others, such as ex-students, who would have a valuable\ninput. At a borough level, there are many minority ethnic\norganisations who ought to be involved in a dialogue about the\neffectiveness of the education service for the children of their\ncommunities.\n9.43 So far as the various stages of education are concerned, we are\nclear that the provision of facilities for the under five's is still\ninadequate and needs to be extended. The Willan Road Day Nursery\nhas made a remarkable contribution, but much more is needed. So far\nas primary and secondary schooling are concerned we are not in a\nposition to make particular recommendations over and above the\nimportant comments which we make about anti-racist policies and\nabout consultation.\n9.44 Given the shortcomings of the education service in the past the\nrole of further and adult education is crucial. It is here that we feel\nthere is a particular need for dialogue between community\norganisations on the estate and educational personnel. There will soon\nbe available the results of the skills survey carried out by the Youth\nAssociation Co-operative. Once skills have been identified, there will\nbe a need to consider how they can be extended and made\nmarketable. Specific programmes tailored to residents on the estate\ncan be elaborated. We are aware that there are courses available at\nthe Tottenham Technical College and the Haringey College which\ncould be of immense value to Broadwater Farm residents. In the\nevent, not many men attend; whilst a lot of women enrol, and there is\na high drop out rate. The causes for this must be discussed and dealt\nwith. As in all other fields, the more that those responsible for the\nprovision of the education service can come into Broadwater Farm\nand discuss problems face to face, the more that there will be a\nconstructive take-up of the important courses which they provide.\n239",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nMEDIA REPORTING\n9.45 Finally, the people of Broadwater Farm ask for fair recognition\nin the outside world of who they are, what they have done, and what\nthey hope still to achieve. Several people saw this Inquiry as the\nmeans of redressing a gross distortion for which they held the mass\nmedia responsible. H. Gordon of the defence campaign said this:-\n\"What I would like to see from the Inquiry is truth come out. I\nwould like see all that has been achieved brought out, the fact that\nwe had Princess Diana come down here, or the programmes that\nwere set up on the estate, how well it was progressing because the\ncommunity had actually worked. I would like to see all that printed\nup and stated. It would go a long way to easing some of what's\nbeing said, and would take out from me a lot of real anger at some\nof the things that have been said about Broadwater Farm. Because\nI do feel angry.\"\n9.46 In our view the anger was justified. We have examined the\ncoverage a total of 25 newspapers for the period from October 1985 to\nMay 1986; 15 were national papers, four were local, three provincial,\none London-wide and four ethnic minority. In Chapter 6 we\nsummarised the reporting of the disturbances and the estate itself. We\nnoted how a series of racially slanted reports described the estate as\nthe place where Whites and Asians lived in fear and vilified\nCouncillor Grant as a figure to be hated and ridiculed. We noted that\nin contrast to the prominence given to PC Blakelock - his life and his\nfamily, Mrs Cythnia Jarrett was virtually ignored. There were no\nreports of the comments of her family and friends about the sort of\nperson she was and why she came to this country. This coverage left\nthe reader no opportunity for empathy and understanding.\n9.47 Towards the end of October some of the national press began\nto direct its attention to Dolly Kiffin under various headlines: \"Dolly\nand her Dynasty\", \"The rise and rise of Dolly Kiffin\", \"Dolly's club\ncash under the spotlight\", \"Police probe a riot estate's godmother\". A\nsystematic campaign of defamation of Dolly Kiffin was orchestrated\nand still continues. It appears to be intended to discredit her and\nremove her from her position of trust in the Broadwater Farm Youth\nAssociation. It may also be an attempt to destroy the Youth\nAssociation itself. One such report led directly to a Fraud Squad\ninvestigation of the accounts of the Youth Association and other\norganisations on the estate. We cannot comment on this investigation\n240\nLOOKING FORWARD: (2) BUILDING A SELF RELIANT COMMUNITY\nin any detail as it still continues, except that we record that the\nintegrity of the officers of these organisations has been praised by\nmany witnesses who have been directly concerned with them.\n9.48\nThe impression gained through all the reports since 6th\nOctober has been that there was no positive relationship between\nBlack and White people on the estate at all. There was no mention of\nthe excellent meal service for the mainly White elderly, and other\nactivities which White people attended at the Youth Association\nbuilding and in other places around the estate. There was nothing said\nof how the campaign to improve the estate, which was spearheaded by\nthe Tenants' Association and Youth Association, had created a great\ndeal of work which had benefitted White people as well as Black. It\nhas meant more White cleaners, caretakers, repair workers and staff\nat the housing office. The press did not mention that a great many of\nthe people who are working on the estate, many of whom also live\nthere, are White and Asian people who have spoken warmly and\npositively about their relationships with Black people. Nothing was\nsaid about the fact that many of the families on the estate are\ninter-racial, or are living in multi-racial households. The press set out\nto emphasise contrast and divisions.\n9.49 Black organisations, who over the past few years have been\nable to receive for the first time, grant aid from central and local\nand\ngovernment, are now being held up as irresponsible\nuntrustworthy. There is talk of \"unscrupulous local leaders\" receiving\ngrants and stirring up racial hatred and riot. Individuals have been\ndefamed, and the public, having no other source of information but\nthe press, tend to accept the information given by the press about\nparticular people. In one article, Dolly Kiffin was described as \"just\nan ordinary West Indian mother with her own talents but without the\nintellectual capacity to run a high profile political campaign\". They\nsay \"she has been manipulated by the far left\". So we are faced with\nanother stereotype, and that is of the Black person who is not really\nas clever and as able as he or she seems to be. If a Black person shows\nthe immense ability, commitment and toughness that Dolly Kiffin has\ndone, it is implied that there must be someone manipulating her,\nbecause according to the stereotype Black people do not possess such\nqualities.\n9.50 Our report has shown in detail much of what has in fact\n241",
            "THE BROADWATER FARM INQUIRY REPORT\nhappened during and since the disturbances. The information which\nwe obtained could have been gathered by the press if it had made the\neffort to do so. When the press chooses to campaign on social issues\nand carry out major investigations into areas of social concern, it has a\nfirst class ability to ferret out information and to bring about change.\nWe remain confident that the press can play an active, positive and\ncritical role in improving race relations and community relations and\nwe believe it has the right to express itself about areas of concern. We\nbelieve however it should do so with responsibility and with regard to\nthe major influence it has for change for better or for worse.\n9.51 In 1975 the National Union of Journalists laid down its first set\nof guidelines for journalists. Two of these were to: only mention\nsomeone's race and nationality if strictly relevant; and resist the\ntemptation to sensationalise issues which would harm race relations.\nThese were added to in 1977 when a joint agreement between the\nNational Union of Journalists and the National Graphical Association\nstated that:-\n\"Freedom must be conditioned\nacknowledgement by all media workers, of the need not to allow\nby responsibility and\npress freedom to be abused, to slander a section of the community\nor to promote the evil of racism.\"\nWe would urge that the N.U.J guidelines and the N.U.J/N.G.A\nagreement be rigorously enforced and to become a disciplinary matter\nin those unions. The Press Council should adopt similar principles and\nimplement them against proprietors who breach them. Furthermore\nthe unions and the Press Council should be monitoring press coverage\nof sensitive issues and major public disturbances.\n9.52 We are concerned not only with the adults of today but with the\nadults, Black and White, of tomorrow. There has been major research\ndone, which was summarised by Sara Goodman Zimet in her book\nPrint and Prejudice, in these terms:-\n\"When characters belonging to minority groups are presented in a\nfavourable light the attitudes of readers moved in a positive\ndirection. However when characters belonging to minority groups\nwere presented in an unfavourable light attitudes of readers moved\nin a negative direction... The research shows that the more\nattractive and desirable the models, the greater the likelihood that\nthe reader will be able to identify with them personally and\ntherefore feel positively towards those characters\"\"\n242\nLOOKING FORWARD: (2) BUILDING A SELF RELIANT COMMUNITY\nLIST OF\n-\nWe fear for the children who are being presented with negative\nimages of Black people through the press images which teach a\nBlack child to feel undervalued and to be ashamed, and which teach a\nWhite child the so-called superior values of Whiteness. We believe\nthat the ordinary White British person would be more ready to accept\nthe ideas of racial justice and of equal opportunities if these were\nproperly explained and not negatively sensationalised.\nCONCLUSION\n9.53 We have enjoyed complete independence in the conduct of this\nInquiry. We now present our Report to the Council of the London\nBorough of Haringey, and at the same time to the people of\nBroadwater Farm Estate and to the wider population of Haringey.\nWe regret the reasons which led to the Inquiry being set up, but we\nhave been privileged to have been part of it. We have each gained in\nknowledge and understanding from what we have heard and read. We\nhave seen how the human spirit can face real and desperate problems\nand overcome them. We conclude our work believing that although\nBroadwater Farm last October passed through the most tragic days of\nits history, there are people enough on the estate, in the surrounding\narea, in council offices, in the police service, and elsewhere, who have\nthe courage and ability to help build a united and successful\ncommunity for the future.\n243\nBISHOPSGATE LIBRARY\nBISHOPSGATE EC2M\n230"
