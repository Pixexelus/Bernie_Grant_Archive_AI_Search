The cases of the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six\nshow that we cannot rely on our judicial system to deal\nimpartially with highly politicised offences such as this one.\nThere are no extradition treaties or diplomatic relations\nbetween Britain or the US and Libya. This makes the handover\nof the two accused men illegal under Libyan law. The British\ngovernment itself admits that there is no framework in\ninternational law for their demands. On the contrary, the 1971\nMontreal Convention obliges the Libyan authorities to\ninvestigate and try the crime themselves, which they are doing.\nansilivio ment to violem or belli\nFrom the beginning of the investigation into the bombing,\nsuspicion centred on Palestinian groups with links to Syria and\nIran. A member of one such group was arrested in Germany in\npossession of a bomb like the one that blew up Flight 103.\nDespite this, he was released, allegedly because he was an\nundercover agent for the German authorities. Scottish police\nhave never been able to interview him. Now that Syria and Iran\nare allies of Britain and the US, they have suddenly disappeared\nfrom the investigation.\n801\nThe Arab League has proposed a special international judicial\ninquiry into the matter. Others have suggested that the case\nshould should be dealt with by the International Court of\nJustice. But these suggestions - acceptable under international\nlaw and to the Libyan government - have been rejected out of\nhand by the US and British authorities. They prefer to try and\nimpose sanctions through the UN Security Council.\nAre Britain and the US afraid of the truth coming out?\nThe No Intervention in Libya (NIL!) Campaign has been\nset up to ensure that there is no repetition of the\nbarbaric attacks on Tripoli and Benghazi.\nWe are also opposed to sanctions because of the disastrous\nimpact that they would have on the economy of Libya and the\nwhole Maghreb region. Instability resulting from the rise of\nIslamic fundamentalism would only be worsened by the\neconomic damage sanctions would cause.\nNIL! is a broad based campaign that already enjoys support\nfrom organisations and individuals in the Labour Movement and\nBritain's black communities as well as the churches and the\nlegal establishment. We believe:\n1. That there should be an independent international judicial\ninquiry into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, with which all\nrelevant national authorities must co-operate fully.\n2. That the British and US governments must respect\ninternational law, and withdraw their threats of economic and\nmilitary action against Libya.\n3.

Baghdad Trip\nThe main purpose of Mr. Grant's trip to Iraq was to establish the\nIraqi position. This was of particular importance due to biased\nmedia accounts of the situation.\nMr. Safieh wondered about the elasticity of the Iraqi bargaining\nposition. Mr. Grant said that he believed this to be quite sound\nHe also felt\nand felt that their demands were quite reasonable.\nthat they were keen to negotiate. He stressed the importance of\nlinkage with the Palestinian situation especially in view of the\nfact that the Palestinian struggle had been going on for forty-two\nHe also felt\nyears and the Iraqi situation for only five months.\nthat it was significant that the Iraqis had stood firm against the\npowerful American empire and that there\nand that there was support among Third\nWorld countries for this initiative. In saying this Mr. Grant\nstressed that he does not support what Saddam Hussein has done and\nis very much aware of the atrocities that he has carried out.\n2. Current situation\nBoth Mr. Grant\nGrant and Mr.\nand Mr. Safieh were in agreement that the\nSwitzerland negotiations looked at the outset quite hopeful and\nIf this\nthat it looked as if a breakthrough might have occurred.\nhad been the case, this would have meant an acceptance of the\nThe media\nlinkage between the Palestinian and Iraqi situations.\nare slow to admit the possibility of this linkage.\nIn\nMr. Grant feels that although it is commonly held that oil is the\nmost important issue in this crisis, he sees this as being\nsecondary.\nHe sees the real issue as being military power.\nhis view, the United States will not be satisfied with merely\nousting Saddam Hussein from Iraq, they will want to position a\ngovernment favourable to American interests there to protect these\ninterests.\n3. Change in Public Opinion?\nMr. Grant felt that attitudes were changing gradually and\nand that\npublic opinion is now shifting towards peace. Mr. Safieh\nexpressed approval at the change in the attitude of the Labour\nParty. Mr. Grant said that this was very positive as it displayed\na marked difference between the attitudes of the two main parties.",
            "00000\nHOUSE OF COMMONS\nLONDON SW1A OAA\nMr. Safieh expressed concern that the American Congress debate\nmight change attitudes once again. Mr. Grant does not think his\nconcern is justified as he feels that a large body of opinion in\nthe United States is opposed to war. He feels that Congress is\nprobably quite evenly split on the issue.\nhave\nMr. Grant feels that public opinion polls here in the U.K.\nshown that public opinion here is also quite evenly split but\nfeels that Mr. Bush's \"war-like rhetoric\" is limiting support for\nthe war option. The anti-war meeting scheduled for Saturday 12th\nJanuary in Trafalgar Square will, in his view influence many\npeople towards the peaceful option. Mr. Safieh asked if Mr.\nEdward Heath would be involved in this meeting. He apparently has\nbeen invited to speak but has not responded yet.\n4. Possibility of War?\nMr. Safieh does not think that there will be a war in the Gulf.\nMr. Grant feels that even if Mr. Bush does not act, Israel may\ntake some action.\n4. Palestine Liberation Organisation\nMr. Grant asked Mr. Safieh about the activities of the PLO. Mr.\nSafieh said that the group was quite active, held regular meetings\nhas a large pool of speakers and a community of approximately ten\nthousand. He felt that one of their main problems was that they\nneeded improved interaction with the British community and\nlobbying on a ministerial level.\nMr. Grant offered to represent them at a parliamentary level. He\nwas recently elected Chair of The Socialist Campaign Group and he\nasked Mr. Safieh to join the group. Mr. Safieh agreed.\nA discussion followed on the nature of Palestinian political\nparties."

They all want to know when you're coming back.\nThe press coverage has been good too, and we had a lot of press\ninterest after you left. Enclosed is a copy of the two interviews\nyou gave to the black press, and other cuttings. We'll send other\ncoverage with Yusef when he comes over next week. BBC World\nService will send me a tape of the International Profile you did\nfor them, and we'll send it on to you.\nAlso, as requested, are enclosed the contact numbers for the\npeople who were with us for dinner last Thursday.\nYou also wanted to be reminded to send a signed photo of yourself\nand President Mandela to Andrew Gilkes, who trimmed your hair. His\naddress is Supreme Hair Design, 12, West Green Road, Tottenham,\nLondon N15.\nFinally, there is a good deal of interest in your coming in the\nAutumn for a speaking tour\ntour around Britain, and we would be\ndelighted to co-ordinate this. As you know there is a good chance\nof getting some funding. If you are willing to come, can you give\nus some definite dates when you'd be available ? Obviously there\nwould be a lot of work to be done to find venues, raise the money,\netc., and we would need to have a firm date to proceed.\nThe tour could of course be a launching pad to establish a Rainbow\nCoalition here, and we plan to have a\nhave a small meeting shortly to\ndiscuss the potential here for this. Is it possible for us to have\nsome documentation about NRC's aims, objectives, and structures so\nthat we have a starting point for this discussion ? I hope that",

They were very\nimpressed, because they\ntake a lot of time over their\nraps, and they decided to\nput it in. So we then started\nrehearsing and they decided\nit was too long so they\nchopped it up into three\npieces and just fitted it into\nthe record.\"\nGrant's contribution to the\nrecord, which also features\njust about every name\nBritish rap act (with the\nexception of Derek B), is\nsuitably blunt and\nunapologetic. It goes: \"The\nsenet\nBROTHER: BERNIE impressed them\nTechnics\n16th Parallel is a line drawn\nby whites through Angola,\nand the racists say that\nblacks can't cross that\nline... The Parallel applies in\nAngola, it applies in Namibia\nand in South Africa, but the\nParallel also applies in Britain\nwhen white racists say that\nblack people, especially the\nyoung, can only go so far\nand no further.\"\nDo you think that your\nnotoriety will effect the\nrecord's publicity?\nbecause I think that it's vital\nfor the people in the street\nto realise that they have a\npart to play in halting the\nracism.\"\nHow did it feel to be\nrapping for the first time?\n\"To me it's very natural. In\nfact, rapping is almost a\npolitician's dream because\nit's very political and the\nmedium is a good one for\npoliticians, I could trundle\nout a few lines in a few\nminutes, which is good.\"\n\"I think it's vital for the people in the\nstreet to realise that they have a\npart to play in halting the racism\"\n\"Well, I don't think I'm\nnotorious, so I can't answer\nyour question.

The last elections were\nheld in 1985 and, as was the case with previous elections since 1968, they\nwere blatantly rigged. To give you an insight into the Guyana Government's\nhistory and present practices in respect of human rights violations and es-\npecially as regards rigged elections, we are enclosing a set of documentat-\nion for your perusal.\nIndications are that the up-coming elections will suffer the same fate un-\nless pressure is exerted on the Guyana Government from both inside and out-\nside the country.\nGuyanese are fully aware of the vital role they have to play to bring about\nfree and fair elections in their homeland. At the same time, they recognise\nthat unless outside pressure is brought to bear on the government of the day,\nthe fulfillment of their aspirations will again be denied. It is in the con-\ntext of another impending rigged election that we seek your support for our\njust cause for free and fair elections, and the restoration of democracy,\nin Guyana.\nWe sincerely hope that you would, after carefully considering the attached\nAPPEAL, find favour with its content and spirit and attach your signature to\nit, thereby demonstrating your support and solidarity with the Guyanese peo-\nple's just aspirations.

            "STATEMENT BY THE BLACK TRADE UNIONISTS SOLIDARITY MOVEMENT ON GRENADA\n30\nThe Black Trade Unionists Solidarity Movement totally condemns the invasion\nof Grenada by forces of the United States of America, Jamaica, Barbados,\nDominica, St Vincent, St Lucia, Antigua and Barbuda. This act of\ntreachery by Black countries is particularly repugnant in view of the racist\npolicies of the United States of America.\nWe also condemn these 6 Black countries for reneging on the agreement of the\nCaricom countries that there should be no military intervention in Grenada.\nThese countries were party to this agreement but went behind the backs of the\nCaricom countries to conclude a dirty deal with the USA.\nWe believe that these countries have been panicked by the success of the\nGrenadian Revolution in providing basic rights like free education,\nhealthcare and employment to its citizens. At the same time, they have\nconsistently denied these rights to their own citizens whilst corruption in\nall these Governments is widespread, encouraged by the USA and the\nmultinational companies.\nWe believe that this act of betrayal of Black People will not be forgotten\nand we call on citizens of these 6 countries to take steps to remove their\nHeads of Government.\nWe also condemn the Thatcher Government for complicity in United States\nracism and imperialism in invading a small Black country. We note that this\nGovernment failed to heed the clear warnings of the invasion just as it\nfailed to heed the warnings of the French intention to prevent Black Britons\nfrom entering France. We believe that the British Government allowed the\ninvasion to proceed on the basis that a puppet quisling Government would be\ninstalled in Grenada to do the bidding of the USA and Britain.\nWe believe that the invasion by the USA follows the American Government's\npolicies of denying Blacks their rights in the USA. It is also clear,\nhowever, that America intends to try and dominate all the non-white peoples\nof the world as well as those peoples who have rejected Capitalism. Grenada\nhas proven that the revolutionary ideas of 110,000 people could shake to its\nvery roots a nation of 200 million people to such an extent, that it was\nforced to abandon any pretence of morality or legality and resort to the use\nof naked force and brutality against the revolutionary ideas of the People's\nRevolutionary Government under Maurice Bishop.\n121\nWe further condemn those responsible for the execution of Prime Minister\nMaurice Bishop, Ministers Jacqueline Creft, Unison Whiteman, Larry Bain,\nTrade Union leaders Vince Noel and Fitzroy Bain, and the other ordinary\nGrenadian citizens who sought to free their Leader.\nYT\nWe believe that these executioners will be dealt with in due course but their\natrocities must not be allowed to cloud the issue of the invasion of a\nsovereign state.\nWe mourn the loss of Cuban and Grenadian lives in their heroic struggle\nagainst enormous odds and congratulate the people of revolutionary Cuba for\ntheir support in building the revolution. We believe that no amount of guns\nwill destroy the gains of the revolution and that the revolutionary struggle\nwill continue in Grenada.\nWe reaffirm that the peoples of Grenada, Cuba, Nicaragua, El Salvador,\nSurinam and the other countries in the Caribbean, Central and South America.\nand the rest of world have an absolute right to self-determination without\nthe intervention of the USA.\nWe believe that Black people in particular should learn the lessons of\nGrenada so as to turn this tragic episode of our history into one which\nunites all Black people throughout the world.",
            "We therefore demand the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from the\nstate of Grenada.\nWe demand that the USA pays compensation to the Grenada Government and to the\nAGAB citizens of Grenada for destroying their beautiful country and killing its\npeople.\nWe demand the setting up of an International Labour Movement Committee of\nInquiry, including Black people in the labour movement, to investigate the\nevents of the past few weeks in Grenada and outside of Grenada.\nThe Black Trade Unionists Solidarity Movement pledges itself to fight\nalongside the New Jewel Movement and any other organisation which will\nsupport the above demands. In furtherance of this the BTUSM will:\n1.Give financial, political and any other support to Grenada through the NJM.\n2.Authorise BTUSM members to issue statements in line with this policy.\n3.Support and organise demonstrations and pickets in support of Grenada.\n4.Raise the issue within the Labour Movement urgently.\n5.Contact Black organisations in the USA to enlist their support.\nThe Black Trade Unionists Solidarity Movement\n30 October 1983.\n29\nis aut nolasini or to epaimsw taslo or bear\nanotin 2018 over of moins doner ads to agai\nstis bewolls ommavo daili ad ad\nad bluow snommer grilaiup, sheque\nChairperson:\nSecretary:\nTreasurer:\nBernie Grant\nTandic Makiwane\nFarida Mayet\nJoint Membership\nSecretaries:\nCorinne Dublin\nFranklin Georges\nConvenors:\nVice Chairperson:\nAsst Secretary:\nAsst Treasurer:\nAuditors:\nD.K.Malhotra\nNeville Adams\nMike Cummins\nCyril Husbands\nShaheen Raoof\nCaspar Murray\nNeville Adams\nConvenors:\nGulam Mayet\nFranklin Georges\nMike Cummins\nAmrit Wilson\nCorinne Dublin\nAddress: Southbank House, Black Prince Road, London SE1 7SJ\nTelephone: 01-735 8171 Ext 178; 01- 582 9478(Direct line)\ned\nbha moitulove: ads to an\nعليا\nBLACK\nTRADE\nUNIONISTS\nSOLIDARITY\nMOVEMENT\nsolismA 02 bas sinc\nlo 200azeledi nisal bloode\ndoidw eno oni groeid o\nA2U adr lo noi"

The properties are largely unfurnished and the\nMontserratians are faced with taking up these properties without any furniture, carpets or\nother essentials. They have no money to buy these items and no alternative but to accept\nthe properties, but the Benefits Agency is refusing grants and loans to these people so that\nthey can buy these items.\nI am not sure exactly what these people are supposed to do, and I do believe it is Britain's\nresponsibility to see that they at least have the basic requirements to subsist here. Surely\nwe cannot expect families to manage without beds, bedding, tables and chairs for example\nas the winter approaches? Many of them are also concerned about clothing their children\nand buying school uniforms etc.\nI do feel that these are matters which cannot wait until the appointments you mentioned\nare made in December via the Refugee Council. These are issues which need to be resolved\nnow either by making special provision under the social security regulations, or by\nproviding a resettlement grant of some kind.\n-\nI would be grateful if you would liaise with the necessary departments as a matter of\nurgency about this, and let me know as what can be done, this week if at all possible.

We have not yet started the recruitment exercise for this\nparticular post.\nTwo short term specialists were engaged for five weeks to produce strategy papers\non general and special needs housing for Montserrat. This was an urgent exercise\nand no candidates from the Black Housing Associations were identified in the time\navailable, despite the efforts of the general housing consultant, who contacted the\nHousing Corporation and the Chief Executive's Office at Ujima. Five consultants\nwere identified, none Afro-Caribbean. Peter Fletcher was chosen because of his\nspecific experience, particularly on special needs housing, and his availability.\nBoth the appointed specialists worked in close collaboration with the people of\nMontserrat.\nThe strategy papers will be available shortly and I will send you copies as soon as I\ncan. Once these papers have been discussed with the Government of Montserrat\nand the details of the technical assistance inputs required for implementation have\nbeen agreed, we will begin recruiting, looking for potential candidates both in the\nCaribbean and the UK.

            "HOUSE OF COMMONS\nLONDON SWIA OAA\nBaroness Symons,\nForeign & Commonwealth Office,\nWhitehall,\nLondon SW1A 2AH\n24 November 1997\nDear Baroness Simons,\nDISPLACED MONSERRATIANS ARRIVING IN THE UK.\nI am growing increasingly alarmed about the utter lack of consideration being given to the\nhousing needs of Montserratians arriving in the UK.\nThey are simply being expected to join the queue along with all other homeless people, at\na time when there is a huge shortage of temporary accommodation in the London\nBoroughs they are arriving in. This means that for many families, bed and breakfast is likely\nto be the destination for periods of up to a year or so. Frequently this is outside of the\nborough, since all in-borough temporary accommodation is already used up. Much of this\nbed and breakfast accommodation is of a shocking standard, and quite unsuitable for those\narriving from Montserrat. This is also creating problems as regards schooling for many\nfamilies, who are having to send children back to the receiving borough in order to go to\nschool.\nLet me take a case in point. Mrs Verna White, of 89, Wallwood Road, E11, has been\nplaced in bed and breakfast accommodation in Waltham Forest by Redbridge Council. She\nhas been placed in one room, along with her 14 year old daughter (I believe she has\nlearning difficulties) and 17 year old son, which in itself is quite disgraceful. The children\nare attending two separate schools back in Redbridge, and Mrs White has to accompany\nher daughter to school and back every day every day, at considerable expense. Redbridge\ntells me that it has a crisis of temporary accommodation, and that it cannot foresee being\nable to move Mrs White in the near future.\nIn my view it is quite unacceptable that traumatised Montserratians are being treated in this\nway, and that the Government must now look at prioritising their housing needs, either by\ngiving appropriate instructions and resources to local authorities, by securing the co-\noperation of housing associations ( I know that some of the black associations would be\nwilling to assist), or by commissioning suitable temporary accommodation in some way.",
            "HOUSE OF COMMONS\nLONDON SWIA OAA\nOne possibility would be to alter the rules in the case of Montserratians, so that if they are\nable to find suitable temporary accommodation in the private sector, they can still be\nregarded as homeless from the point of view of eventual re-housing by local authorities.\nYou testified before the Select Committee recently that local authorities are to be given a\ngrant of some £1500 to assist them in housing Montserratians. I was pleased at the time\nto hear this. However it appears that this grant is only available to those who arrive here\nthrough the MAPS scheme, and who are directed to a local authority by Travelcare. Those\nwho present directly to a local authority do not attract this subsidy. This really is most\nunfair on the very boroughs who have borne the brunt of receiving Montserratians in recent\nmonths. In Haringey, and I believe Hackney, for example, already under severe pressure\nbecause of their position as major refugee \"receiver\" boroughs, most Montserratians have\nreported directly to the local authority Housing Departments, having arrived there because\nof the presence of friends and family in the resident population. These boroughs will\ntherefore receive this subsidy in very few cases indeed, and yet these are the very ones\nwho need assistance.\nPresumably those local authorities who condescend to accept the odd Montserratian here\nand there, will receive the subsidy, whereas those who are taking the bulk of them will\nreceive little. I know that my own local authority is extremely angry that despite all its\nefforts in recent months to assist in the Montserratian crisis, they are being discriminated\nagainst so far as the subsidy is concerned. Perhaps you could tell me how many subsidies\nhave been paid, and to which boroughs, and also press the Department of the Environment\nto review the position urgently.\nI would be most grateful if you would liaise with he relevant departments on both these\nissues, and let me know as a matter of urgency what can be done.\nYours sincerely,\nBERNIE GRANT\nMEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR TOTTENHAM"

In London over the last two years, the trend has shown a\nreduction in reported crime. However, within that trend there is\nanother which gives me cause for concern. That is that crimes of\nviolence against people showed a marked and unacceptable increase.\nMost crimes of violence are committed by people who are well known\nto their victims, but there is a worrying upward trend in the\nnumber of street robberies - the kind of offence we generally call\nmugging and which nearly always involves some form of violence.\nRECEIVED FRON\n230",
            "AND-YARD TEL:071-230-4246\n07 Jul 9F\n202\n03 No.003.03\n-2-\nIt is a fact that very many of the perpetrators of muggings are\nvery young black people, who have been excluded from school and/or\nare unemployed. I am sure I do not need to spell out the\nsensitivity of dealing with this crime problem which is, of\ncourse, much more than just a police problem.\nI would welcome the opportunity to talk to you and your colleagues\nabout it on 28 July, though I do appreciate the problems you might\nhave with that date. I have also invited some other interested\npeople to that meeting, including members of Consultative Groups.\nThe\nPlease let my secretary know if you will be able to attend.\nnumber is 0171 230 2346 or 3838\nI look forward to seeing you.\nPL Condon\nRECEIVED FROM 071 230 4246\n07.07.1995 11:08\nP. 3"

(a \"type\" of car?). Surely in light of all the years of community\npolicing and racial awareness training that the police have undergone that it is lamentable that\nthey are unable to come up with a more sensitive and less insulting categorisation.\nThe high number of Stop and Searches conducted on African and African-Caribbean peoples\nin Haringey is cause for serious concern and we observe that the same pattern follows for\nBoroughs where there is a large Indian and Pakistani community. We would hope that other\nMPS and RECS share the same concern.\nI can assure you that we have not let this matter drop and that the issue of the figures for\nStop and Search in both Hornsey/Wood Green, and Tottenham were highlighted at Haringey\nREC's General Council Meeting on Wednesday 15th February 1995. The police are aware of\nthis and it is the intention of this Council to seek a meeting, in the near future, with both\nSuperintendents from Tottenham and Hornsey Divisions with a view to hear what action has\nbeen taken to address this matter.\nIt was kind of you to invite the Chief Officer and myself to the meeting, at the Haringey\nCommunity and Police Consultative Group offices, to meet and discuss the issue with police\nofficers and others in attendance.\nI also note that it is your birthday today - please accept my belated congratulations and best\nwishes.\nYours sincerely\nEddie\nEddie Wedderburn\nCHAIRMAN\nHonorary President:\nMAYOR OF HARINGEY\nRegistered Charity No.\n1007024",

It seems to me\nthat if the constant stopping of\nBlack people is routine, then\nit's a pretty bad routine.\nNational figures issued last\nyear sparked an outcry at the\nrevelation that nearly half of\nBy Anthony André\nall the people stopped and\nsearched were, not surprising-\nly, from ethnic minorities.\nAlthough the rules govern-\ning police stop and search\nchanged dramatically in the\nmid-80s with the introduction\nof The Police and Criminal\nEvidence Act of 1984\n('PACE') when strict guide-\nlines demanded that police\nofficers should have reason-\nable grounds for suspicion\nbefore carrying out a search -\nit has made little difference.\nNew Scotland Yard has\ndenied abusing the stop and\nsearch laws. They said: \"We\nstrongly refute any suggestion\nthat the Metropolitan Police\napplies stop and search laws\nin a racially-discriminatory\nmanner.\"\nCondemned\nBut Mr Grant, sharing a\nplatform with Andrew Pudde-\nphatt, general secretary of\nLiberty, the civil liberties\ngroup, condemned the police\nfigures.\nGrant said: \"Every day,\nsomewhere in London, aver-\nage Black people are being\nsubjected to the indignity of\nstop and search. It is clear that\nBlack people in particular are\nbeing singled out by the police\nto an extent which cannot be\njustified.\"\nArgument\nBlack people account for\n25.5 per cent of stop and\nsearch incidents London-wide\nyet, according to the popula-\ntion census, represent only\nabout 9 per cent of London's\npopulation thus reinforcing\nthe discrimination argument.\nIn the capital, however, it is\nnot only the Metropolitan\nPolice that have come in for\ncriticism. The City of London\nPolice has also come under\nfire accused of using their\nhighly-publicised 'ring of\nsteel' anti-terrorism security\ncordon to stop and search eth-\nnic minorities.\nA spokesman defended the\nforce: \"The style of policing\npractised in the city includes a\nhighly visible, pro-active uni-\nformed presence, supplement-\ned by advanced camera tech-\nnology.\"\nHe added that they would\ncontinue to employ such\nmethods for prevention and\ndetection purposes, \"in rela-\ntion to all styles of criminali-\nty\".\nNow both Mr Grant and Mr\nPuddephatt are calling on the\ngovernment to suspend the\nimplementation of further\nchanges governing police stop\nand search - in the light of the\nnew Criminal Justice Bill.\nThey are demanding\ndetailed examination and\nresearch into current figures\nbefore additional police pow-\ners come into force in March\nof this year.\nTheir concern is centred\naround clause 55 of the Justice\nBill, which they believe will\nrenew the right of the police to\nstop and search anyone on a\nwhim, without having 'rea-\nsonable grounds'. This, they\nbelieve, will lead to increased\npolice harassment of ethnic\nminorities.\nThe new powers will grant\npolice the right to stop and\nsearch anyone within a specif-\nic area around which a serious\ncrime has taken place.\nHampshire Chief Constable\nHoddinott spokesman for the\nAssociation of Chief Police\nOfficers argued: \"The exer-\ncise of this power will be care-\nfully monitored - in particular\nregarding ethnic classifica-\ntion.\"\nDespite these reassurances,\nMr Grant underlined his deter-\nmination to carry the fight fur-\nther, and vowed to urge shad-\now Home Secretary Jack\nStraw to pursue the argument\nin the House of Commons.\nGrant concluded: \"If you\nlook at these published fig-\nures, you can only imagine\nwhat the real figures are like.'\nV212",

I have delayed writing to you formally as the\napproval and ratification of my Fixed Term Appointment has been the subject of\nlengthy procedural wrangling between the Metropolitan Police Service and the MPC\nand I wanted to be in a position to give you firm information about policing\narrangements for Tottenham.\nLet me say from the start that I feel real regret at giving up the command of Tottenham\nDivision after only one year. My promotion came as a complete surprise to me and\nwhen, back in November 1994, I said that I anticipated remaining in Haringey for the\nremaining years of my service, I truly expected that would be the case. I have an\nimmense affection for the Tottenham - I find it a vibrant and friendly area despite all its\nproblems where people of good will, who are in all positions of influence, can make a\ntremendous difference. To that extent I have been at pains to ensure that I can\ncontinue to have a link with the operational policing of the borough in order to impact\npolicy at the all important strategic level.\nMy Assistant Commissioner, Baden Skitt, has therefore agreed that I will have an\ninspectorial overview of the activity on Tottenham and Hornsey Divisions (and\nincidentally in the boroughs of Barnet and Hertsmere as well). Clearly day to day\nresponsibility will fall to the divisional commanders at both places but I will retain my\nposition on the Upper Lee Valley Partnership, will continue to develop initiatives with\nthe North London TEC, and of course will continue as co-sponsor of the vital local\ninitiative on Stop and Search which you and I launched last year. You will see that my\nintention is to be as closely involved in Haringey as I ever was.\nOn a personal level, I would like to say how much I have enjoyed working with you\nand that I sincerely hope we will continue to work together for the people of Haringey.\nMembers of Parliament are in bad odour at the moment, not least because many are\n1",
            "perceived, rightly or wrongly, to be insincere. In all my dealings with you insincerity is\nnot a charge that could be laid at your door. May I suggest that as soon as my\nsuccessor at Tottenham is appointed, whoever he (or she!!) might be, then perhaps\nSharon and yourself could join us for lunch in order that I can make the necessary\nintroductions.\nYours sincerely,\nDavid GILBERTSON\nلسنه\n2"

        "extracted_text": "FOREWORD\nHOUSE OF COMMONS\nLONDON SWIA OAA\nNothing has been more damaging to the relationship between the Police and the Black\ncommunity than the ill judged use of Stop & Search powers. For young black men in\nparticular, the humiliating experience of being repeatedly stopped and searched is a fact\nof life, in some parts of London at least. It is hardly surprising that those on the receiving\nend of this treatment should develop hostile attitudes towards the Police. The right to walk\nthe streets freely is a fundamental one, and one that is quite rightly jealously guarded.\nI have never argued that the Police should not have the power to stop and search, when\nthey have real cause to suspect criminal activity. What I have argued however, in\nParliament and elsewhere, is that the unnecessary use of Stop & Search powers has now\nbecome so extensive as to amount to an abuse of civil rights, and to a means of harassment\nof the black community in particular. The figures produced in late 1994 in answer to my\nParliamentary question, showing huge growth in the use of Stop & Search powers, and\ntheir disproportionate use against Black people, did no more than confirm what the\ncommunity already knew.\nThis report examines the project launched in Tottenham in the wake of the 1994 figures.\nIts aim was to seek ways of increasing understanding about the use of Stop & Search, by\nboth the officers who use these powers on the one hand, and by the community on the\nother. Those senior Police officers who facilitated this project, and who understand the\nimportance of seeking solutions to this complex problem, are to be congratulated.\nHowever, as the Report amply demonstrates, this attitude is not shared by all Police\nofficers. There remain entrenched views, some of which are blatantly racist, and a\nresistance to change of any kind in the use of Stop & Search. Of significance is the fact that\nthe vast majority of the officers interviewed do not live in the area, are not from our\ncommunity, have little knowledge of it, and are not accountable to it.\nThe precise impact of the leaflet project is arguable, although it is gratifying to see that the\nnumbers of Stop and Search incidents fell dramatically during the period of the project -\nwithout any noticeable effects on crime clear-up rates. As the report notes, this may well\ndue to the cessation in Tottenham of the abominable practice of using Stop & Search\nincidents as a performance indicator, for internal Police management purposes. In itself this\nmust be welcomed, but should be extended nationwide.\nWhat is abundantly obvious is that the work on monitoring Stop & Search activities must\ncontinue, and that discussions with the community must be ongoing. The price of not doing\nso may well be too great to contemplate, and I hope that this report will be the start,\nrather than the end, of our efforts to address a problem which has been a running sore for\nfar too long.\nBERNIE GRANT M.P.",

To rise to such a high rank in\nyour profession is something of which you must be very proud, and I am sure that you will\njustify the faith which your superiors have placed in you as you carry out your new\nresponsibilities.\nThose of us who got to know you in Tottenham are not at all surprised that you were\nchosen for promotion. In the short time that you spent with us, we came to realise that you\nwere a different kind of policeman - one that we could trust and work with in the interests\nof the whole community. I personally appreciated your honesty, and willingness to talk\nopenly about the problems of policing Tottenham, in the context of the problems of the\ncommunity as a whole. Sadly there have been few of your predecessors who have been\nprepared or able to match your creativity and integrity in this respect, and on behalf of\nTottenham, I thank you the commitment you showed to us.\nClearly we are very sad to lose you, and somewhat worried about having to develop a new\nrelationship with your successor. As you know we have had quite a considerable turnover\nof command at Tottenham in recent years, and we do need some stability.\nI am glad that you will still have inspectorial responsibilities in relation to Tottenham, and\nI am sure that in that capacity will shall have cause to be in touch from time to time. Please\ndo feel free to contact me if I can ever be of help to you in any way.\nYours sincerely,\nBERNIE GRANT M.P.",

Under the Act a uniformed police\nofficer requires reasonable suspicion of find-\ning a stolen or prohibited item. The focus\nis on burglary, street robbery, illicit drug\nuse and carrying offensive weapons.\nThe London and\nnational figures\nraise legitimate\nconcerns about\nthe use of stop\nand search\nagainst black\npeople\nThe Act also requires the police to col-\nlect and publish statistics monitoring their\nuse of stop and searches powers. These\npowers were increased under the Criminal\nJustice and Public Order Act 1994 which\nallows the police to stop and search any\nperson or vehicle for dangerous instruments\nin an area where 'incidents involving seri-\nous violence may take place'.\nNo element of reasonable suspicion is\nrequired and a refusal to co-operate is a\ncriminal offence.\nDespite heavy reliance on stop and search\nonly a small number actually lead to arrest.\nIn 1993, only 13 per cent of the 442,800\npeople stopped and searched were actually\narrested.\nA report compiled last year by crimi-\nnologist Jock Young showed that in the\nFinsbury Park area of North London there\nwas evidence of greater involvement of black\npeople in street crime than in burglary and\ndrugs-related offences.

In these instances it may be misleading to compare the number of black people stopped and\nsearched and their proportion in the population. - These figures were not available\ntern of\nprofile.\nstop and searches on a street crime\nClass shed some light on why some\ngroups were more likely to be stopped than\nothers. For example, Asians and Africans in\nthe area tended to be professionals or stu-\ndents. Hence, more Irish people, who tended\nto be working class, were stopped.\nHowever, though many Afro-\nCaribbeans were middle-class, a dispropor-\ntionate number were stopped. The report\nconcluded this was \"because their appear-\nance generates suspicion in terms of the\nstereotypes held by the police\".\nThe London figures provide the first\nlarge-scale evidence that black people, par-\nticularly of Afro-Caribbean origin, are more\nlikely than people from other ethnic groups\nto be stopped and searched. Furthermore,\nthe higher rates of black searches in bor-\noughs with smaller black communities may\nbe interpreted as direct or at least indirect\nevidence of police discrimination.\nIt would be foolish to intrpret police\nactions directly from either the London or\nnational figures. However, the figures do\nraise legitimate concerns about the use of\nstop and search against black people. Fur-\nthermore, given the low rate of arrests that\nfollow stop and searches, equally legitimate\nquestions are raised about the effectiveness\nof this police strategy to fight crime.\n(House of Commons Hansard,\n1.12.1994,2.12.94; Policing The Street,\nStops and Search in North London, Jock\nYoung, Centre for Criminology, Mid-",

I spoke to the subject and there\nthen followed an animated and extremely useful debate which allowed for contributions\nfrom the floor. It was finally agreed that the matter would be remitted to the next\nmeeting of the Executive Committee by which time it was anticipated that I would have\nbeen able to send a detailed reply to you.\nIn essence your letter raises two separate but related issues.\ni) The seemingly excessive increase in the total number of searches conducted\nunder the Police and Criminal Evidence Act in 1994 compared with 1993.\nii)\nThe possibility that this may be a function of racial bias by my officers.\nThe latter point is of course of fundamental importance and goes to the heart of my role\nas a senior police commander. It is vital that you and the community you represent have\nconfidence in my commitment to maintain and ensure the highest standards of behaviour\namongst my personnel, for without such confidence the whole concept of community\npolicing and policing by consent is flawed.",
            "-2-\nDealing first with the increase. I of course acknowledge that an explanation is\nappropriate, but would argue that when viewed against the background of National Key\nObjectives, Metropolitan Police strategic priorities and divisional objectives in relation to\nperformance against crime, the increase could be argued to be valid.\nmham\nDivisional objectives, which were first formulated in 1992, were framed after close\nconsultation with all sections of the local community and set policing priorities for the\nfive years up to 1997. In this context objectives 4 and 5 are particularly relevant. The\nrequirement to provide high visibility policing to reassure the public and to target and\nprevent crimes which impact heavily on the quality of life of local people, is a function\nof the way in which officers are briefed and deployed.\nAs you acknowledge, stop/search powers are a legitimate means of preventing and\ndetecting crime. Officers are kept up to date with all relevant information concerning the\nlocation and timing of offences and the description of suspects as provided by victims.\nThey are encouraged to use their powers to detect offenders and indeed they have a\npublic duty to so, for local people have a right to expect that their police are active and\ndiligent. The sensitivity of such activity and its impact on community relations is well\nunderstood by me and my senior officers. All officers are trained to ensure that they fully\nunderstand the legislation and codes of practice. Most importantly, they are reminded\nthat the grounds on which they can conduct a search are closely defined and that misuse\nof their powers would render them liable at law and under the service disciplinary code.\nThere is a causal link between poor community relations and misuse of police powers - I\nam fully conscious of the need therefore to ensure that such powers are used\nappropriately and in the relevant circumstances. My research would tend to indicate that\nthe increase is due to a combination of the following factors:-\n1. The steady month on month increase in cases of street robbery which has led to\nofficers being directly tasked to areas of high incidence, particularly Seven Sisters\nRoad and Bruce Grove.\n2. The displacement of crime and offenders away from burglary towards street robbery.\n3. The improved quality of intelligence.\n4. The use of information technology as a means of quickly assessing and evaluating\nchanging crime patterns.\n5. Recent evidence of a proven link between drugs and crime.\n6. Increase in the ease of availability of dangerous drugs, particularly Heroin and Crack\nCocaine.",
            "-3-\n7. Linked to 6. above, stop/search and arrest identified as a legitimate means of\nintervention for referral of users to helping agencies.\nCommunity\n8. The increasing criminal use of firearms and firearms related offences on Tottenham\nDivision, requiring an assertive response.\nIt may also be the case, although this can only be surmised, that there was significant\nunder-reporting of searches last year, in that officers may have failed to submit routine\nreports in respect of those straight forward searches which were brief and where nothing\nwas found.\nA training programme during the last 12 months has sharpened such\nprocedures and part of the increase may have occurred as a result.\nYour comment about the arrest rate is valid but I should point out that Tottenham\ncompares well with London as a whole where the overall ratio is static at around 10%.\nIn so far as ethnicity is concerned, you will wish to know that in advance of directions\nfrom the Home Secretary under S.95, Criminal Justice Act 1991, the Metropolitan Police\nbegan the ethnic and gender monitoring of stop-search in September 1992. From April\n1993, Her Majesties Inspector of Constabulary requested all forces in England and Wales\nto ethnically monitor stops as part of 49 performance indicators. It was anticipated that\nthe statistics would be published for the financial year 1993/94 in Summer 1994, but this\ndid not happen. I am informed by the Commissioners Central Staff that publication of\nthe latest figures will now take place in the financial year 1995/96 (i.e. at some time after\nMarch 1995), but the form in which they will be published has yet to be determined. As\nan issue of strategic importance it is currently receiving attention at the highest level in\nthe service.\nThe interpretation of any statistical data requires a great deal of care and specialist\nknowledge. None of us should do anything that would allow ill-intentioned people any\nopportunity to misuse statistics to reinforce racial stereotypes.\nI hope this letter goes some way towards reassuring you or that at the very least it can be\nused as a starting point in our discussions. I have referred your request for the regular\nprovision of statistics, to my Assistant Commissioner and I will write again when I have\nhis view on the subject.\nThe issues raised in your letter are of such importance that it would clearly be\nadvantageous for us to meet. I will contact your office in the next week or so to make the\nnecessary arrangements.",

            "000\nHOUSE OF COMMONS\nLONDON SWIA OAA\nChief Superintendent Gilbertson,\nTottenham Police Station,\n398, High Road,\nLONDON N17 9JA\n7th November 1994\nDear Chief Superintendent Gilbertson,\nRE: TOTTENHAM\n-\nSTOP AND SEARCH STATISTICS\nMay I first of all welcome you to your new post in Tottenham. I\nhope that we will enjoy good relations, and that\nthat it will\nit will be\npossible for us to meet from time to\nfrom time to time to discuss Policing\nissues in Tottenham. As\nAs you will no doubt know from your\npredecessor Alan Wright, this has become a useful means of\ninformal co-operation.\nI am sorry to press you so soon after your arrival on the question\nof Stop and Search incidents in Tottenham. This is an issue which\nhas concerned me for some time, and which was to have been the\nsubject of a meeting between myself and Alan Wright last week. Due\nto my own illness however, I'm afraid that the meeting could not\ntake place, and thus I must now raise the matter with you.\nPerhaps it would be helpful if I explain the background to this. I\nrecently noticed\nnoticed a marked\nmarked increase in the numbers of stop and\nsearch incidents in my constituency, and requested comparative\ndata from the Tottenham Police. Supt. Robbins kindly provided me\nwith the figures for the number of Stop and Search Incidents in\nTottenham for the second quarter of 1993 along with the figures\nfor the same period this year and the number of arrests arising\nfrom these incidents.\nThe fiqures for the second quarter of this year represent\nvirtually a 100% increase over last year. In total 2,403 people\nwere stopped and searched in the second quarter of 1994, compared\nwith 1,233 last year. Of these only 205 were arrested (not\nconvicted), compared with 124 last year. Thus 2,198 people were\nsubject to stop and search procedures, which in the event were not\njustified, in this three month period.\nThese figures are worrying. On this basis, one could expect almost.\n10,000 people to be stopped by the Police in Tottenham in any one\nyear. Out of every 10 of those, only one would have been stopped\nwith justification. The other nine will often have been forced out\nof their car in full public view, had its contents thoroughly\nsearched, and been delayed on their way for a half an hour or so",
            "00000\nHOUSE OF COMMONS\nLONDON SWIA OAA\nwhilst checks are made for no real reason.\n-\nWe all understand the need for the Police to be pro-active in the\neffort to prevent crime. However there is a balance to be struck\nbetween the proper exercise of their responsibilities in this\nregard, and the protection of basic liberties. People have a right\nto go about their business without hindrance, and where such large\nnumbers of people are being stopped, that right is in danger of\nbeing eroded.\nThere is also a balance to be struck between preventative Police\nwork and good community relations. People do not enjoy being\nstopped and searched, especially if they are entirely innocent.\nWhere an individual is repeatedly stopped for no good reason, or\nwhere a particular section of the community appears to be being\nstopped frequently, considerable resentment can be caused.\nI am concerned as to the ethnic distribution of those being\nstopped in this way, and would be grateful if you would provide\nthese statistics. My own observations are that it is black\nmotorists who seem to be being\nbe being stopped disproportionately,\n(although not exclusively) and this is consistent with the many\ncomplaints which have been made to me by constituents.\n'\nI am sure that you will recall the serious problems which the old\n\"sus\" laws created for the black community in particular. You\nwill also be aware of the enhanced stop and search powers which\nthe Police have been given under the new Police and Criminal\nJustice Act. In this context, I believe that the dramatically\nincreased instance of Stop & Search must be a cause for grave\nconcern, and the situation needs careful monitoring. I would be\ngrateful therefore if you would let me have all future statistics\non Tottenham stops and searches as they become available.\nWhat would also be helpful would be some indication of how the\nincreased incidence of Stop and Search compares with other areas\nin London. Is it possible for you to supply me with statistics for\nother areas ?\nI would of course be more than happy to meet with you to discuss\nthis matter. Perhaps when you have had time to settle in your new\npost, you would like to arrange a convenient time with my office.\nI have also written to the Haringey Community and Police\nConsultative Group, and H.R.E.C. to express my concern about\nthis.\nYours sincerely,\nBERNIE GRANT M.P."

And therefore no access to the goods and services and styles of life which many of\nus on the Council take for granted.maH woberle bne viste1092 amo artritiw gniteam ineptus o\nI ask all Members, and particularly the Members representing the wealthier western parts of the Borough:\ntry for a moment to put yourselves in the position of those young black people.vo stoupaba gnile\nBut economic deprivation has been with us for years, and extends far beyond Broadwater Farm Estate.\nYet it rarely leads to a revolt of the kind we saw on Broadwater Farm.

Policing which is frankly racist.art yd beauso al siriT diguosod\nDon't take my word for it. Cast your minds back to last year's Policy Studies Institute report on the\nMetropolitan Police - commissioned by the police themselves. Researchers who spent two years working\nwith the police found that, and I quote:\nto\nmarinetto\n\"Racialist language and racial prejudice were prominent and pervasive... racialist talk and racial\nprejudice are... on the whole expected, accepted and even fashionable... we cannot produce\npa examples of police officers objecting to racialist language or arguing with others who express racialist\nviews.\"\nbne states must\nof\nпо\nThey found that the police make a crude equation between blacks and crime; and that black people are\nmore likely than whites to be the victims of indiscriminate stop-and-search procedures.

As a black Council leader in an area affected by the disturbances, I have\nbeen in a unique position - and my responses have been emotional as well as political. I know that some\nthings could have been better said. But I have told the truth - a point I will come back to later. And I insist\non the importance of what I have been trying to say. I have been trying to articulate the perceptions of\nthose young black people who do see the police as their enemy. I have been arguing that theirs is an\nauthentic social response - not a product of original sin or mythical outside agitators. It is one voice in our\ncommunity, and if we try to suppress it, or pretend it is not there, we will make the situation worse.\nto s\nThe need now is to embark on a process of reconciliation.

We want a start made on implementing the modest proposals of the\nScarman report.or\nvtinumm\nto enoitos\nsoling air to namepanem ad gnism yd beveidos ed vino neo airs eveiled eW.enot\nNext I want to say something to the police themselves.

I call on the police to show some respect for the young people of\nHaringey. Two people have died in the chain of events which started on Saturday 5 October. That is\nenough. There must be a rethink of how Tottenham is policed and the Council is prepared to play a full part\nin that.\nA vinummos e to anoi\nbrie lsloos erit\nloos erit evonami of worl bns nom\nIt is no secret that Members on this side at first considered more drastic action to convey to the police our\nsense of outrage. We did agree that we could only pay the police precept, when it next falls due, if certain\nconditions were met. I have received a direct appeal from the Leader of the Labour Party, Comrade Neil\nKinnock, to step back from this threat. The Labour Group has agreed to do so, to avoid any further\npolarisation. We ask the police to show the same willingness to rethink their own position.\nNext I want to speak to the young people of Tottenham. I said earlier that I had spoken the truth last\nweek about their situation and their attitudes. Now I want to speak my mind to them.\nI want to say that some things are wrong. Drug-trafficking is wrong. Thieving is wrong. Attacks on old\npeople are wrong. Many of them have spent a lifetime fighting oppression also.\nucho yd bein",
            "And I want to say to the young people: violence offers no solution to your problems. You can't fight\nhatred with hatred. You can't fight fear with fear. You can't fight violence with violence. The State's\nresponse will always escalate. Next time, rubber bullets and CS gas will be used. The time after that, the\nArmy will be brought in. M to nolasini sisemel, yol to gniqqate oraineys to ex\nThe only way forward is through political action. I believe that the line I have taken over the last week has\nopened up at least the possibility of drawing young people into a dialogue about peaceful political solutions\nto your problems. If we could achieve that, it would be a great step forward. So I appeal to you: step back\nfrom the violence and allow the Council to speak for you. senqan ym bne\ndemos lliw Iźnion s\nI also want to say something to the Borough's employers. Strangely enough, I can't do better than to\nquote the editorial in Friday's 'Hornsey Journal':\nstood\n\"Hands up every employer who has said: I won't employ blacks - they're lazy.\"\nThe Council has been making major efforts to live up to its claim to be an 'equal opportunity employer'.\nWe still have a very long way to go. But I ask the Borough's other employers: please join our efforts.\nNext, I want to say some words to the press. There are more of you here tonight that is usual when we\ndebate Haringey's pressing problems. You have it in your power to shape people's perceptions of the\ncurrent crisis. You can trivialise, you can personalise, you can distort - you can inflame the situation, or\nyou can cool it down. We appeal to you to help us to cool it.\nCour\nFinally, I turn to what the Council itself can do.\nFirst of all, we can clear up the mess. Our employees have already responded magnificently to the\nemergency at Broadwater Farm, and I hope every Member of the Council will join me in thanking them all\nfor that. We will also meet the residents affected to see how the Council can help them to pursue their\nclaims for compensation.\nhelor of emod of trem\nSecondly, we have a responsibility as the Borough's elected representatives to tackle the crisis of polic-\ning in Tottenham. If the Government refuses to do so, this Council will establish its own independent\ninquiry into the recent events, and the wider breakdown in police/community relations which they repre-\nsent. We know that many sections of the community live in fear, and need the protection of a responsive\nand responsible police force. We believe this can only be achieved by making the management of the police\naccountable to elected Members.\nThirdly, we have to give a new priority to the needs of the Borough's young people. Within the Education\nService, youth provision has been the Cinderella for too long. We will continue to fight for jobs for young\npeople, and we are looking very very seriously at the establishment of a full Youth Committee of the\nCouncil to give a new priority to services for young people.\nLast, but not least, we need to rebuild a future for Broadwater Farm. The Youth Association, the\nTenant's Association and the Council have made great strides in bringing confidence and sense of\ncommunity to the estate. Obviously, the recent events are a major setback. The Council must respond with\nnew initiatives. We need the ideas of all the estate's tenants on how to make it a safe and happy environ-\nment; and how to improve the social and recreational facilities for all sections of the community. And then\nwe must find, or fight for, the resources to make these ideas a reality.\nбалба\nComrade Mayor, I have spoken long enough. I end on this note. The events of Saturday 5th and Sunday\n6th October have happened. They cannot be wished away. They are a reality which we have to tackle.\nMet The Council will redouble its efforts to overcome the economic and social deprivation of Tottenham, and\nthe disadvantage and racism which its black residents face. We want to ensure that all the people of\nHaringey, black and white, young and old, can go about their lives free of the fear of violence. I include in\nthat the violence of unemployment, the violence of poor housing, the violence of poverty. We believe we\nI have a right to insist that the Government stops attacking us and starts to help us.\"\n016 дово\nPrinted by Borough of Haringey\nBG/1/2/1/8"

The public meetings, pickets etc. organised by the\nCampaign have been invaluable in placing the issue of this injustice on the\npublic agenda.\nHowever, the Defence Campaign remains very much a community organisation;\nits agenda dictated by the needs and hopes of the local people. While we\naccept that it is the role of the Defence Campaign to tackle issues such as\npolice harrassment, operation Kingfisher etc., we feel very deeply that a\ncampaign with an aim as important as the release of these three innocent\nmen needs to have its own identity in a national form.\nIt is for this reason that we have taken the decision to form the Families\nCampaign. In the past, you have been one of those whose support we and the\nprisoners have welcomed and been grateful for, and it is for this reason\nthat we have written to you.\nThe Committee will be an independent and non-funded body. If our campaign\nis to keep up the very considerable momentum which it has achieved, we\ndesperately require funds so that we can establish an office, continue to\nlobby parliament and the media effectively, and build up a nationwide\nnetwork of supporters.\nWe therefore urge you in the strongest possible terms to make an immediate\ndonation to the campaign. Please make all cheques payable to the Tottenham\nThree Families Campaign. We also plan to publish a list of sponsors of the\ncampaign. We hope that - if it is appropriate you will agree to place\nyour name, or that of your organisation, on this list.\nIf you have any questions about the Campaign please call our office (081-\n809-6483) or get in touch with us via Sharon (081-888-1714) or Shaun (081-\n985-6140). We look forward to hearing from you soon and welcome your full\nsupport in the future.\nYours Sincerely,\n6 Raghip\nChair, Tottenham Three Families Campaign.",

He has been\nportrayed consistently (and effectively) as a black 'monster'\nfigure by a racist media and police in order to legitimate what has\nbecome known one of the most clear-cut cases of human rights abuse\nin the United Kingdom (see Amnesty International report, enclosed).\nThe recent exposure of the fabricated nature of the 'evidence'\nagainst Silcott (see below) has been the final element in the now-\ncomplete discrediting of the Tottenham Three convictions.\nWhen the Broadwater Farm disturbances took place in October 1985,\nSilcott was remanded on bail after being charged with an unrelated\nkilling. He was arrested in connection with the Blakelock killing\nwhen he reported to Tottenham police station six days after the\ndisturbances to fulfil his conditions of bail.

Raghip was thus\nconvicted on the basis of the 'joint enterprise' argument\ndespite the British government's condemnation of the use of\nuse of the\nidentical argument of 'common purpose' in the Sharpeville Six trial\nin South Africa. Since the trial, it has emerged that Raghip is of\nborderline sub-normal IQ, functionally illiterate and abnormally\nsuggestible.\nMark Braithwaite eventually told police that he had struck an\nofficer with an iron bar. The description of the officer in the\nstatement which he gave does not fit Blakelock, and there were no\nwounds on the latter's body corresponding with the blows that Mark\n'confessed' to striking. Since the trial it has been shown that\nMark suffers from severe claustrophobia.\n3",

When Home Secretary Kenneth Baker\nreferred Silcott and Braithwaite back the appeal court he told the\nmedia that the Broadwater Three interviews were conducted before\npresent codes of police practice were in force and tape recording\nbecame commonplace. Repetition of recently exposed miscarriages, he\nclaimed, \"therefore seems unlikely in future\". (Guardian 27/9/91)\nThis is not the case.\nPACE was in force during the investigation\nthe investigation into the Blakelock\nmurder. When Silcott and Raghip were arrested a 'dry run' of PACE\nwas being conducted in Tottenham. Braithwaite was arrested after\n1st January 1986, when PACE became law.

Bad housing, a squalid\nenvironment, high levels of unemployment, poverty, racial discrimination\nin the job market, the sense of powerlessness which these social pressures\nproduce, the exploitation of that sense of powerlessness by drug pushers\nand other criminals, all contribute to urban unrest. These problems\nhave been well documented and have been endlessly analysed. We do not\ntherefore advocate any further inquiry of the kind conducted by Lord\nScarman four years ago. What is needed, we believe, and needed\nurgently, is Government action to implement Lord Scarman's proposals,\nand those of the Commons Home Affairs Committee of the same year, for\na co-ordinated and well directed attack on inner city problems in\ngeneral and on racial disadvantage in particular. We welcome recent\npress reports that the Government is now examining its inner city\npolicies with a view to developing that sort of strategic attack, and\nwe urge that this examination should lead to imaginative action on\nthe scale required, backed by political will and expenditure commensurate\nwith the need.\nYer I betonpt ad Jonno anodisp\nadavad\nth\nWe make\nPolicing issues\nWe see\nthe Me\nto the sub\ntan Police to\nticisms of\n3\nBut our discussion last week was concerned with the immediate causes\nof the disturbances in Brixton and Tottenham, and it is on this subject\nthat I have been asked to write to you.\na A\nIn both places the rioting\nwas preceded by, and developed out of, a spontaneous outburst of ord\ncommunity anger and grief, generated by the shooting of a black woman\nand the death of another black woman in the course of search-and-entry\noperations by the police.

Equally widespread\nis the belief that black people frequently experience racial harassment\nand abuse on the streets. Careful monitoring of all the media reports\nof the rioting shows, significantly, that whenever young people in the\nareas concerned, and especially young black people, were given an\nopportunity of explaining why the riots occurred, they invariably talked\nnot of social deprivation or even of unemployment, but of their gut\nreaction to a style of policing which they regard as \"heavy\" and\ndiscriminatory. This explanation has been endorsed by some older people\nin the black community who is no way condone the violence that ensued.\nIt is a view which also receives some support, as far as L District is\nconcerned, from the warning given by the Lambeth Panel of Lay Visitors\nin their report to the Consultative Group for the first six months of\nthis year that, on the basis of complaints made to them of ill-treatment\nduring arrest, there appeared to be a deterioration in police behaviour\non the streets, especially in Brixton and Clapham. Criticism of this\nkind of police behaviour during the period leading up to the riots has\nbeen extended by some responsible observers to include allegations that\nno during and after the riots individual officers assaulted or otherwise\nmistreated innocent black people who were trapped by the affray\nallegations which reinforce the community perception of police aggression\nand racism.\nbre\nJon of sw beavisne vlaseIbne need even bris bedomoob low need sved\nThese allegations will be familiar to you.

            "HARINGEY COMMUNITY RELATIONS COUNCIL\nEXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEETING, 23 SEPTEMBER 1982\nREPORT OF THE SENIOR COMMUNITY RELATIONS OFFICER\n1.\n2.\nBROADWATER FARM\nA short report on Broadwater Farm arising out of the serious\ndeterioration in the relationship between the Police and sections\nof the Residents.\nThe estate was opened in 1970 when it was acclaimed as an up-\nto-date example of modern design and good industrialised building\ntechniques. It is made up of 1.063 units with seven deck access\nlow rise blocks, 27 terraced houses and two tower blocks. A\nshopping precinct, with a doctor's surgery, was included.\n3. By mid-1970, a number of problems were obvious. There were water\npenetration and dampness, a faulty district heating system and\ncockroach infestation through the piping ducts. A substantial\nnumber of tenants were refusing offers of rehousing on the\nestate. The people who more readily accepted accommodation\nwere invariably those with the least choice. They included a\ndisproportionate number of homeless and one-parent families and\na significant number of the unemployed.\n4.\n5.\nThe resultant effect was, among other social and economic factors,\nimbalance in the age ranges on the estate. In an attempt to\nredress this worrying situation, the Housing Committee, in 1978,\nimplemented a policy of letting to the children of existing\ntenents to the newly-wed and to single people sharing flats.\nBy 1980, the 1978 policy was abandoned due to the acute housing\nshortage across the borough and the feeling that allocations\nwere sufficiently flexible to avoid any further undue concentration\nof low income and homeless families on Broadwater Farm. This\nassumption, as it turned out to be, was wrong and in a nine\nmonths period ending in early June 1981 eighty five per cent of\nthe two and three bedroom units on the estate were allocated to\nthe homeless.\nIn the meantime, the specific problems and the general dis-\nsatisfaction about the estate inevitably led to increasing\nfrustration and racial tension. There was violence between\ntenants, a spate of burglaries, vandalism, swastika and other\nracist daubings, and attempted arson on black families. As a\nresult, police surveillance was noticeably increased. This\nincrease coupled to the police methods adopted led to a most\nserious deterioration in the relationship between tenants and\nthe police, including the home beat officers. In July this\nyear, on two seperate occasions a policeman was hit over the\nhead and injured. On a third occasion, another policeman was.\nsimilarly hit but was only slightly stunned.",
            "-\n2 -\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\nOur Police Liaison Officers have been intermittently involved with\nincidents on the estate and have made several visits to the estate\nusually in response to appeals from the police. The ambivalent\nattitude to our Police Liaison Scheme has made it extremely\ndifficult for us to establish and subsequently maintain consistent\nand ongoing links with the estate. There have been, however,\nseveral instances when assistance has been rendered to individuals\nand families.\nOne significant reason for the level of racial tension has been\ncommunity involvement or lack of it by the black residents on the\nestate. In 1970 a Tenants Association was established and was\ncontinually under white control and domination until 1979 when it\nwas forced to deal with the wide range of problems affecting the\nestate. By May 1982, a new constitution was adopted making the\nAssociation and its Social Club more democratic and multi-racial.\nThis change resulted in a degree of acrimony between different\ninterests groups on the estate and although the acrimony has\nsubsided some tension still persists.\nA Community Worker had been allocated to the estate, but has now\nleft due to the situation outlined in the preceding paragraph. He\nhas not been replaced thereby leaving the estate without the badly\nneeded services of such a worker. The Youth Service has placed\na detached youth worker on the estate and the Community Development\nUnit has been giving support and advice to the new community self-\nhelp initiatives, particularly the Broadwater Farm Youth Association,\nwho recently promoted a highly successful weekend festival on the\nestate. Our Council gave financial assistance to this particular\nproject and has also, over a period of time, given substantial\nassistance to the Blue Archers Netball Team based on the estate.\nThe deteriorating situation, particularly with the police, forced\nthe Local Authority to positively respond to the fear that there\ncould be an outbreak of serious disorder on the estate. As the\nlandlord, the Authority was seen as having an obligation to take\naction. It was decided to allocate approximately £160,000 in\n1982/83 for improvement to security doors controlled entry systems,\nfencing and play facilities. A further £500,000 have been embarked\nfor planned maintenance involving painting and renewal of woodwork.\nA series of meetings have been held between the Police, Senior\nCouncillors and Officers and Residents of the estate in the Civic\nCentre and more recently on the estate. The tension has since\ndropped considerably and there has been a reappraisal of policing\nthe estate. The fear of serious disorder now appears to have\nreceded.\nIn the absence of any ethnic records being kept, it is estimated\nthat the level of black tenants is between sixty per cent to\neighty per cent of all tenants. There is general agreement that\nit is sixty per cent at least. Allegations are somewhat rife\nthat there is a deliberate policy to turn the estate into a\nblack ghetto' while there might be no hard evidence to substantiate\nthis claim, the fact that black tenants are disproportionate on\nthe estate was bound to lead to several assumptions.",
            "-\n3-\n11.\n12.\n13.\nThe physical state and appearance of the estate does not readily\nsupport the allegation of being a 'ghetto' or 'sink' estate\nand the recent decisions to spend two substantial sums of money\non improvements are indicative of a policy decision to avert\nsuch a situation. But, however, there remains the irrefutable\nfact that successive housing policies have resulted in the\nincredibly high concentration of black tenants on this estate\nas against other estates.\nIt is also strongly felt that management transfers have exacerbated\nthe situation. White tenants on the estate would appear, in the\nabsence of any ethnic records, to be able to successfully lobby\nfor transfers elsewhere while black tenants on the estate who\nsimilarly apply for a transfer are usually turned down.\nThroughout the several discussions I had with people about the\nestate, it was strongly felt that the Local Authroity had abrogated\nmuch of its responsibilities over the past decade. There was no\nresponse to the early changed situation on the estate when it was\nobvious that the residents would have needs different from the\nneeds envisaged by the planners. It was also obvious that the\nracial mix on the estate was swiftly becoming different from\nthe racial mix on other estates in the borough and elsewhere\nacross the country. It was a known fact that racial tension had\nbeen growing since the mid-1970s and no action was even contemplated,\nlet alone taken, to deal with this situation. There was no\npositive response to racist literature sent to black tenants,\nracist daubings, and attempted arson until the recent spate of\ndaubings nearby in North Tottenham, followed by the public demand\nfor a positive response.\nThe several initiatives taken in the past two years should, if\ncontinued and strengthened, avert the likelihood of the estate\ndegenerating into a 'ghetto' or 'sink' estate. The Local Authority\nwill be central to the future of the estate, and must be seen to\nbe playing its part to the full. I would, therefore, recommend\nthat:\n(1) there be an early inquiry/survey into the situation on\nBroadwater Farm to accurately and objectively determine\nthe extent of the several problems, personal and collective,\naffecting all tenants on the estate.\n(2)\n(3)\ntwo experienced Community Workers be allocated on a\nfull-time basis to the estate as speadily as possible and\nthat one worker be black and the other worker white to\nmaintian an equalibrium of trust, confidence and impartiality\nbetween black and white tenants on the estate.\nan early meeting be held between the Police, and the Local\nAuthority, and Haringey Community Relations Council to\ndiscuss and take appropriate action on the problems on the\nestate as they affect policing on the estate and environs.\nJeff Crawford\nSENIOR COMMUNITY RELATIONS OFFICER\nSeptember 1982"

Canon Sebastian Charles\nDorothy Kuya\nDr. Paul Corrigan\nRandolph Prime\n1214\nHCre\n4th Floor\nCambridge House\n109 Mayes Road\nWood Green\nLondon N22\nTel: 01-888 3453\nPolice Staged 'Practice Run For a Riot' Inquiry Told.\nPolice staged a practice run for a riot at Broadwater Farm\nEstate,\nTottenham weeks before last October's disturbances,\nthe independent Broadwater Farm Inquiry heard on Sunday.\nRumours that a riot was imminent on Broadwater Farm were\nbeing spread by police though there was no basis for them,\nmembers of the estate's Youth Association told the six person\npanel of Inquiry at its second hearing of evidence at\nBroadwater Farm Junior School.\ncome\n-\nOf the 'practice run' in September, police were said to have\ndown to\nthe estate from everywhere. \"There was\nhelicopters, Rovers, policemen on horseback. They came down\nfor no reason%3B there was nothing going on on the estate. They\nwere on a test run for a riot\", a member of the Youth\nAssociation told the hearing.\nAssociation Youth worker Mr Stafford Scott confirmed the test\nrun and added: \"For years, we have known that every office in\nTottenham Police Station has a large scale map of Broadwater\nFarm drawn off, and they have areas marked in red, where\nshould anything happen, they will take the estate. It was\n'proven' on their test run that they could take the estate in\nten minutes said Mr Scott.\n\"\nRumours of an impending riot in Tottenham had been going\naround since the disturbances in Handsworth in September\n1985, said Mr Scott. But his brother, voluntary worker Mr.\nMillard Scott told the Panel that every summer Tottenham\nPolice Station went on standby\non standby because they believed there\nwas going to be a riot. \"They always have an influx of men\ninto the area when the time gets hot.\" he said.\n\"The plans\nthey use show that they were prepared to subdue a riot on\nBroadwater Farm from 1983, and the riot never took place\nuntil 1985, which means they thought they had reason to make\nthose plans. Therefore, they have always been anticipating\nour actions towards them, never their actions towards us\".\n1",
            "Rumours of imminent trouble was always passed on by police to\nthe 'right places' such as to the council and race relations\nbodies he added. They would say%;B \"They're going to riot up\nBroadwater Farm, we've heard about it, we know.\" he said.\nThey would back up this with evidence such as there had been\npractice throwing of petrol bombs. But Officers sent down to\ninvestigate claim that they found no evidence, no scorching\non the ground; no glass on the ground nothing.\n-\nBut they still persisted in saying: \"They're going to riot.\nWhat they think is, that we're so stupid that we'll riot for\nno cause whatsoever\".\nPeople could not understand why police\nput round rumours\n\"Tottenham\nevery year in Tottenham, said Mr. Stafford Scott.\nis not an area where they've had riots before. In 1981 when\nthey had riots and copy-cat riots, there were no such things\nin Tottenham... people from Tottenham have not been arrested\nin large numbers at any other riots, so it's not as if\nthere's any militant core there that would trigger a riot.\nThe beliefs the police had were totally unbased. But the\nfact that they had these beliefs meant that they were going\nto act in a manner that would create such a day. And the day\nwas October 6th.\"\nIn the week prior to October 6th, there had been heavy police\naction in the area. \"Black people were being stopped in\ntheir cars as they drove onto the estate\". said another\nwitness, Mr. Harry Adams, also of the Youth Association.\nMembers of the Youth Association were addressed by the\nleaders and urged not to react or let themselves be provoked.\n\"What they were trying to do was to antagonise people to get\na reaction. And we were saying to people just keep calm and\nthey'll go away\". said Mr. Adams.\nThere had in fact been no reason for the police to believe\nthat tension was rising, said the Youth Association\nrepresentatives. Mr. Stafford Scott referred to an incident\nquoted in DAC Richards' report in which\nin which the Asian-owned\nsupermarket in the estate's shopping centre was daubed with\n\"The supermarket was daubed with things\ngraffitti:\nlike\nNiggers rule' I don't know any black person who would go\naround and write such a slogan. That just smacks of another\ngroup of people, non-black people, putting that there to\nthrow the blame on the black sections of the community.\"\nRejecting the idea that the increase in police stopping and\nsearching of black youths had been sufficient to raise\ntension, Mr.\nMillard Scott said, \"We've been stopped and\nsearched for years%3B it's nothing new. Everybody who has been\nin Tottenham has been stopped and searched at some time for\nsomething. Once you're black and on the streets, that's the\nbottom line. So there is no reason in 1985 that we should get\nup and decide to riot about it.\"\n2",
            "Said Mr. Stafford Scott, \"If you go and tell your friends, 'I\nwas stopped and searched today, they won't all say 'Oh\nthat's terrible.' because they actually know it's a mundane\nsubject now.'\nAsked whether the riot would have happened if Mrs. Jarrett\nhad not died, Mr. Scott replied: \"If Mrs Jarrett hadn't\ndied, none of you would have been here speaking to us. This\nwould not have happened.'\nSpeaking of Mrs. Jarrett's death, Mr. Scott said that the\ndeath of anybody in 'those kinds of circumstances' would have\ncaused some kind of reaction. \"The fact that she was a\nmother was important because historically black people have\nalways been matriarchal.\"\nIt was mundane for black youth to be stopped\nbe stopped and searched.\nsaid Mr.\nMr. Scott \"So when a black youth hears that a black\nmother died as the result of her son being stopped and\nsearched for an out of date tax disc and the police then go\nto her house and she dies, it is very easy for that youth to\ntransfer what happened to Floyd Jarrett to themselves.\"\n\"So on this day, when first people heard it, it was very easy\nto actually transfer that it wasn't Mrs Jarrett and it wasn't\nFloyd Jarrett, it was me,\nStafford Scott and my mum, Mrs.\nScott, and that it is how the community felt and that's why\neverybody suddenly poured into the community.\"\nPress Contact: Howard Hannah 888-3453\n-\n3"

            "REPORT FOR CHAIR OF SOCIAL SERVICES\nLONDON BOROUGH OF HARINGEY\nSOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT\nJUVENILES AND THE POLICE AFTER BROADWATER FARM RIOTS\nThe purpose of this report is to raise some of the issues and concerns of the\nSocial Services Department which have come as a result of the treatment of\njuveniles by the police after the Broadwater Farm riots.\nThese comments need to be seen in the context of the Departments responsibilities\nfor the welfare of young people. I am not in a position to judge whether the\nactions of the police were justifiable or not in a legal sense.\nThe Department has two main concerns. Firstly the treatment of the young.\npeople as human beings and secondly the attitude of the police to the\nquestioning process.\nYoung people from 12 years old upwards were being held in police custody for\n72 hours before being brought to the Court. In one instance where the boy was in.\ncare already, the social worker had to insist that reasonable washing facilities\nwere made available after the boy had been held for 24 hours. This boy was a\nslow leamer in educational terms and was eventually charged after being in\ncustody with burglary and offensive weapons NOT murder.\nOne 12 year old boy was detained for 36 hours before being released.\nHe was picked up by the police at 8.30 in the morning but was not interviewed,\nso far as we know, till 4.30 that afternoon. The social worker understood that\nthe offence. the boy was supposed to have committed was stealing some Mars Bars\nbut the majority of the questioning was concerned with who he had been with\nand who he had seen on the night of the riots.\nOne 14 year old boy was held for 72 hours plus 2 police remands of 24 hours\na total of 5 days in police custody. He was eventually charged with murder.\nOne 13 year old boy having been in police. custody for 55 hours without seeing\nhis family or a solicitor was due to be charged with murder. When the duty\nsocial worker arrived at the special Court she found the boy wrapped in a\nblanket over some kind of paper garment with no shoes on.\nHis mother gave\nhim clothes just before his actual appearance in Court. At least one other\nboy was wearing paper clothes and had no shoes. One boy wore a pair of\nenormous mens trousers and large shirt. One family said they had all the\nchildrens clothes removed by the police.\n1..",
            "year old was picked up by the police at 7.15 am.\nOne 16\nsolicitor were denied access to him until 1.30.p.m.\nHis mother and\nA number of points arise at this stage:-\n1.\nThe Department believes it is not in the spirit of the childrens\nlegislation for young people to be kept in police custody for up to 5 days.\nIndeed I believe that juveniles should not be held for more than 24 hours\nA number of the young people involved\nbefore being brought before a Court.\nhad no previous offences.\n2. As the police are allowed to hold juveniles for periods of more than 24\nhours then the police station should be properly equipped and the personal\nneeds of the young people properly catered for.\n3. Accepting\nBoys of\nthat the police needed to remove clothes for forensic tests,\nA quick call to the\nthere was no need for their clothes not to be replaced.\nSocial Services Department or the parent would have achieved this.\nthis age dressed in paper clothes, with no shoes are reminiscent of a century\nAgain many of them had no previous offences and of course the charges.\nago.\nagainst them had not been heard fully.\n4. While the police are allowed to hold juveniles then their parents should\nhave access to them within 24 hours. Clearly the police would be able to\ncontrol what went on during that access but at least it would enable the\nIn one case a 13 year old was in\nyoung person and parent to see each other.\ngreat distress in Court as he believed his 12 year old brother had been\nbeaten by the police. Subsequently his mother told a social worker that her\nAgain one has to bear in mind that some of the\nson had received a black eye.\noffences for which these young people were picked up were not serious and\nnot proven.\nThe troubled relationship between the Social Services Department and the police\nover interviewing obviously has major implications for the young person.\nAs the 2 weeks after the riot went by, the attitude of the Department became\nfirmer so that we are at present operating a policy that social workers should\nnot be present as the responsible adult during questioning unless there is a\nsolicitor present.\nOne 13 year\nThe kind of situation that led us to this position is as follows.\nold white boy was due to be questioned by the police on Friday 11th October.\nHe said\nThe social worker was present and the interview lasted from 5.50 pm till 9.30 pr\nThe social worker was questioned as to his role.\nwith short breaks.\nit would be to make sure the boy was properly looked after, the length of the\ninterview was reasonable and the style of questioning was acceptable.\n1\ni",
            "At the end of the interview the social worker asked if the police were going.\nto charge the boy so the boy could then come into the care system. The police\nsaid they would continue to hold him 'incommuncado' and they would be\ninterviewing further the next day. The social worker asked if a solicitor\ncould be present. The police refused.\nOn the following day the social worker consulted the boys solicitor and\ndecided on the appropriate course of action. When the police asked the social\nworker to be present, the social worker said that he had consulted with the boys\nsolicitor. On the basis of this the police then said that the social worker\ncould not be present at the interview. This young person subsequently made\na statement, in the presence of a person from the police panel of community\nrepresentatives implicating himself very seriously in the riots. Once he\nhad access to his solicitor he was then advised to change the statement.\nA further example is a request by the police on 12.10.85 for a social worker\nto attend interviews of juveniles. The duty social worker explained that he\nwas not able to do so but had arranged for a solicitor who could be present.\nThe police turned down this offer.\n---\nAlso on 12.10.85 another request for a social worker to attend an interview.\nWhen the social worker explained that a solicitor could attend the policeman\nsaid he did not want \"any bloody solicitors because they tell the kids not to\nsay anything\".\nThe Department had to think clearly about the reasons for involvement in the\ninterviews. If you look at the problem from the point of view of a parent\nit is obvious that where such serious charges as murder were being talked about\none would want a solicitor present to make sure that the questioning was\nreasonable. Obviously the police needed to find out what had happened but\ncqually obviously this investigation should be carried out correctly and undue\npressure not put on young people without proper safeguards.\nIt seems to me from this. experience that in such serious circumstances juveniles\nshould have immediate access to legal representation.\nThis would ensure that the questioning was done appropriately having regard..\nto the young persons age and his social and educational maturity. This is\nparticularly so where the young person is at special school. for example for\neducationally sub-normal children.\nThe other point is that the Social Services Department needs to have\nunambiguous guidelines for the involvement of staff in police interviews of\njuveniles. These must define how far this should be an active role. The guidelines\nshould be discussed with the police. At least one young person claims that the\npolice put pressure on him outside the formal interview, to admit some involvement\nin the murder of the policeman.",
            "CONCLUSION:\nI have only been able to present a partial picture at this point.\nA more complete picture would need a proper enquiry looking into\nthis particular aspect of the riot and would need to involve in\nsome way everyone who had contact with the young people at this\ntime.\nWJH/YT\n23.10.85."

Bad housing, a squalid\nenvironment, high levels of unemployment, poverty, racial discrimination\nin the job market, the sense of powerlessness which these social pressures\nproduce, the exploitation of that sense of powerlessness by drug pushers\nand other criminals, all contribute to urban unrest. These problems\nhave been well documented and have been endlessly analysed. We do not\ntherefore advocate any further inquiry of the kind conducted by Lord\nScarman four years ago.

We welcome recent\npress reports that the Government is now examining its inner city\npolicies with a view to developing that sort of strategic attack, and\nwe urge that this examination should lead to imaginative action on\nthe scale required, backed by political will and expenditure commensurate\nwith the need.\nYer I betonpt ad Jonno anodisp\nadavad\nth\nWe make\nPolicing issues\nWe see\nthe Me\nto the sub\ntan Police to\nticisms of\n3\nBut our discussion last week was concerned with the immediate causes\nof the disturbances in Brixton and Tottenham, and it is on this subject\nthat I have been asked to write to you.\na A\nIn both places the rioting\nwas preceded by, and developed out of, a spontaneous outburst of ord\ncommunity anger and grief, generated by the shooting of a black woman\nand the death of another black woman in the course of search-and-entry\noperations by the police.

Equally widespread\nis the belief that black people frequently experience racial harassment\nand abuse on the streets. Careful monitoring of all the media reports\nof the rioting shows, significantly, that whenever young people in the\nareas concerned, and especially young black people, were given an\nopportunity of explaining why the riots occurred, they invariably talked\nnot of social deprivation or even of unemployment, but of their gut\nreaction to a style of policing which they regard as \"heavy\" and\ndiscriminatory. This explanation has been endorsed by some older people\nin the black community who is no way condone the violence that ensued.\nIt is a view which also receives some support, as far as L District is\nconcerned, from the warning given by the Lambeth Panel of Lay Visitors\nin their report to the Consultative Group for the first six months of\nthis year that, on the basis of complaints made to them of ill-treatment\nduring arrest, there appeared to be a deterioration in police behaviour\non the streets, especially in Brixton and Clapham. Criticism of this\nkind of police behaviour during the period leading up to the riots has\nbeen extended by some responsible observers to include allegations that\nno during and after the riots individual officers assaulted or otherwise\nmistreated innocent black people who were trapped by the affray\nallegations which reinforce the community perception of police aggression\nand racism.\nbre\nJon of sw beavisne vlaseIbne need even bris bedomoob low need sved\nThese allegations will be familiar to you.

During\nthe miners' strike, powers to prevent\nbreaches of the peace were used to turn\npickets back on public roads hundreds of\nmiles from their destinations, while such\noffences as riot and affray were used\narbitrarily to effect\narrests of\ndemonstrating miners and their supporters.\n(Two or\nmore\nPeople\nthreat-\nening\n(another...\nAffray.\nB\nmass\nСь\nPSSST....\nanoitibnoo\nLepitiloq lo\nse odi doum\nbonovistni visos\nto 088\nod lliw viilsool\ndws doidw Tobag\nIn protests over the Newham 7 case, the\npolice were able, through force of numbers\nand riot equipment, to prevent\ndemonstrations from following their\nplanned routes.

This is\nsignificant because, in the past, many of\nthese charges have failed to stick (for\ninstance, in the Bradford 12 and Newham 7\ncases, charges of conspiracy were dropped\nlargely as a result of community pressure,\nand recently, riot charges against the miners\nhave failed to stick). With an eye to the\nexperience of the miners' strike, increases in\npenalties and police powers are proposed in\nrelation to the ancient offence of 'watching\nand besetting' a person's home or work\nplace. Yet, no explanation has been given\nof why this offence has not been used by the\npolice to control racial harassment; nor is\nthere any indication that it will be so used in\nthe future! Instead, the White Paper\nsuggests a further new offence of\ndisorderly behaviour', supposedly for\ndealing with racist thugs; but the offence is\ncast so widely as to constitute a revival of\nthe 'sus' laws primarily used against black\nyouths in the past.\nigizo\nPolice arbiters of legitimate anomob\npolitics\ngmimiss solloq\niw sonoloiv lutwalau\nBut it is not just the obvious effects of the\nWhite Paper that need to be considered.\nTaken as a whole, it will serve to redefine\nand narrow the scope of 'acceptable'\npolitical activity.

But\nonce you step outside these official\nchannels, once you question their validity\nor try to defend the community against\nfascist incursion, police harassment,\ngovernment cuts in housing, educational or\nwelfare provision, you run the risk (under\nthe proposed legislation) of becoming the\n'enemy within'.

They contact the police to give\nthem advance notice. The police say that\nthe march can go ahead, but impose the\ncondition that it must avoid all the main\nroads and shopping areas and keep to the\nquiet residential back streets. The reason\nfor this, they say, is 'to prevent serious\ndisruption to the local community'.\nThen, police intelligence officers hear\nfrom police informers that at least 1,000\npeople are expected to demonstrate. The\nrecently appointed and rather nervous local\npolice chief seeks and obtains a ban on the\nmarch the morning it is due to take place.\nHe warns those organising the\ndemonstration that if it goes ahead they\ncould go to prison for up to three months\nand that anyone simply taking part could be\nfined up to £400.

The\nreturn of black people to black countries should be part\nof a reparations package-to apologise for colonialism\nL\nReparation, not\nrepatriation\nast week, the Voice newspaper broke\nan agreement with me to do a serious\ninterview on the future for black\npeople in Britain. Instead they chose\nto trivialise and sensationalise remarks I\nmade at a small meeting in Brighton, taking\nthose remarks completely out of context.\nWhat I was talking about at that meeting\nwas the future for black people in this country.\nI said that this must now be the subject of a\nserious debate within our community. I make\nno apologies for that.\nI believe that we must stop reacting to\nevents and go on the offensive. For too long,\nthe black community has preferred to sweep\nthings under the carpet, and been afraid to talk\nabout what is happening to us, let alone about\nthe options for the future. We are now mature\nenough to have that debate, and there is no\ntime to lose.\nFor the vast majority of black people in this\ncountry, little has changed since we or our\nparents came here in the fifties and sixties. We\nare at the bottom of every single pile-for\nexample in housing and jobs-and the culture\nand traditions that enabled us to survive in the\npast are being destroyed. We have suffered\nmore than anyone else from the recession\nhitting this country. In particular, we are con-\ncerned about the future for our children, who\nare getting an education of which we do not\napprove, and who have nothing to look for-\nward to but the dole.\nIf\nyou add to this the growth of racism and\nfascism, and the rise in racist attacks and\nmurders, many of us are beginning to feel\ndistinctly nervous about our future. The way\nin which our black brothers and sisters are\nbeing treated in Europe makes us shudder.\nAnd when we hear that British ministers are\nsitting down with their European counter-\nparts to discuss \"common approaches\" to\ndealing with \"migrants\" and the like, we have\nreal cause for alarm. The established political\nparties in Europe have merely accommodated\nracism, and all the signs are that they will do\nso here.\nSo do we just go on reacting? I think not.\nPersonally, I am fed up with going on one\ndemonstration after another whenever a black\nperson is murdered. It's time to start talking\nstrategically.\nI dissociate myself completely from the\nviews of fascists and the right wing. I have\nnot spent my life fighting against racism in\nthis country to play their game. Their line is\nthat black people in this country have no right\nto be here, and that they should go back to\n\"where they came from\".\n15 OCTOBER 1993\nMy own vision of the future for us as black\npeople is connected with the campaign for\nreparations for Africa. I have been involved\nin this for some time, and there is now serious\nwork going on in relation to this in Britain and\naround the world. I believe that it offers us\nboth a way of understanding our situations as\nblack people here in Britain, as well as a\nglimpse of an alternative future.\nneed to understand that racism\nagainst black people grew up as a\n\\ Africa in centuries past. If black\nway of justifying the exploitation of\nThis is claptrap, of course. We have every\nright to be here, we are British citizens, and a\nlot of us were born here.\nHowever, the fact of the matter is that there\nare many black people who are now voting\nwith their feet, and going to live in black\ncountries where they have connections. They\nhave had enough of the\nhardship, and the daily\ninsults, and want to find\nsomething better for\nthemselves and their\nchildren. They don't\nwant to spend the whole\nof their lives fighting\nracism. Many have al-\nready sent their children\nto black countries to be\neducated properly and\nto give them the self-\nconfidence that comes\nfrom living among\nother black people.\nThere are a lot more\npeople who come to me\nasking for help to go\nhome. I see no reason\nwhy they shouldn't get\nit if they want it- after\nall, they have worked\ndamned hard in the\nworst jobs in this\ncountry and are owed\nsomething.\nNow, I am not saying\nthat this is any solution\npeople could be stereotyped as sub-human\nand worthless, then there was no reason why\ntheir land and raw materials could not be\nstolen from them through colonisation, why\nthey could not be murdered in large numbers,\nand why they could not become the slaves of\nthe white man.\nThe colonisation and exploitation of Africa\nand the enslavement of African people must\nbe the biggest crime in the whole of history,\nI have not advocated\nrepatriation. I am in\nto our problems in this favour of black people\ncountry, and it is cer-\ntainly no substitute for\ncarrying on the fight\nagainst racism here. I\ncan assure you that I\nwill be as upfront as\never in that fight.\ntalking among\nthemselves about how\nwe go forward in a\nhostile environment\nI have not advocated\nrepatriation, as some of\nthis week's headlines\nhave said, nor am I in\nfavour of any crude policy of \"paying blacks\nhome\".\nto go\nWhat I am in favour of, however, is of black\npeople talking among themselves frankly\nabout how we go forward in an increasingly\nhostile environment, and considering all the\noptions. The only problem with this is that we\ncannot do so in this society without our being\noverheard by the white media, and by right-\nwingers like Winston Churchill who distort\nour views for their own ends.\nand one from which we\nstill suffer, both materi-\nally and psychologi-\ncally. Yet we never had\neven an apology, let\nalone any form of\ncompensation.\nThe reparations\nmovement demands\nthat the debts of black\ncountries be cancelled\nand that substantial\nsums be repaid to them\nto invest in their future.\nThis is, of course, a\nlong-term goal, but\nsomething that offers\nsome hope to black\npeople in a global sense.\nIn this context, there are\nmany black people\nwho, if they were given\nthe positive prospect of\nparticipating in the re-\ndevelopment and re-\nemergence of black\ncountries, would wish\nto do so, especially if\nthey were supported in\na structured programme\nfunded in the spirit of\nreparations by those\nwho have exploited\nblack people for so\nlong. This is a far cry\nfrom any idea of run-\nning away from our\ncurrent situation, or of\nrepatriation.\nThese are not new\nideas, and the mention\nof them should not have created the fuss it\nhas. I shall certainly continue to talk about\nthem. I am not prepared to let the racists and\nthe fascists set the agenda, and do not accept\nthat it is politically incorrect to talk about\nanything that holds some alternative for black\npeople in the future. We have to begin the\ndebate now, before things get any worse.\nBernie Grant is the Labour MP for\nTottenham\nNEW STATESMAN & SOCIETY 15",

In 1992, abo-\nriginal human remains were.\nreturned to Australia and talks\nwith native Americans led to\nthe return of a Sioux Ghost\nShirt, a garment taken from\nthe body of a brave after the US\nArmy slaughtered more than\n200 men, women, and children\nin 1890.\nThe largest collection of\nBenin relics in Britain is held\nat the Museum of Mankind in\nLondon, which refuses to enter\ninto discussions about their\nreturn.\nMr Grant, who was acting as\na spokesman for the Benin\nroyal family, said: \"I am not\nsaying that all of them should\nPicture: COLIN TEMPLETON\nbe taken away, only the signif-\nicant ones.\n\"The Scots set a lot of store\non the Stone of Destiny. Now\nthat it has been returned I\nthink the rest of the world will\nsee the Scots as being two-\nfaced if they are quite happy to\nI have their relic returned but\nnot do the same themselves.\nThese belong\nto a living\nculture and\nhave a deep\nhistoric value.\nBernie Grant\nMr Grant said the relics are\npart of a \"surviving and living\nculture\" that relies on them as\na guide to traditional cere-\nmonies and dress.\n\"The Africans draw and\nmake sculptures to consult\nrather than write things down,\nmany ceremonies are now not\nbeing performed satisfactorily\nbecause many of the bronzes\nare missing,\" he said.\nMr O'Neill said the museum\nhad a \"moral imperative to pre-\nserve the heritage of Glasgow\nand enlighten local people\nabout Benin\".\nHowever, Mr O'Neill said the\nmuseum could be sympathetic\nto the request despite Mr\nSpalding's letter, which states:\n\"Though it is possible for our\nmuseum service to restitute\nitems. . . we cannot advise the\nCity Council that this should\nhappen in this case. . . these\nartifacts have an important\nrole to play in the public sec-\ntor.\"\nMr O'Neill said he would\nhave to be convinced by an\nindependent expert that Glas-\ngow's collection was unique\nbefore restitution could be con-\nsidered. He told Mr Grant: \"If\nwe went through every object\nand assessed how it got here,\nthen we could be in a situation\nwhere we were repatriating 60\nor 70% of our collection and I\ndon't think society has reached\nthat stage.\n\"The bottom line here is that\nwere are not in the business of\nredressing historic wrongs.\"",

            "I\nINTRODUCTION\nam a lawyer who has striven for\nhuman rights and justice in many\nrule in the white world have been\ncompelled to recognize that the\nrights of non-white peoples are\nfounded in justice. It is then that\nforms of legal redress, which may\nnot have existed before, have been\ndevised.\nparts of the world. Much of my\nwork has concerned the manifold\ninjustices which are caused by the\nevil of racism. Especially, I have\nstood in solidarity with Black people\nin Britain in their bitter and continuing\nstruggle for equal rights, and with the\nliberation movements of\nMozambique, Angola, Guinea-dnublandlords or employers to put up\nBissau, Zimbabwe, Namibia and\nSouth Africa in the cause of saib\ncomplete African liberation. I now live\nelavilabl\nand practice law in Jamaica.\nI believe that the cause of\nReparations to African and Africans\nin the Diaspora is rooted in\nfundamental justice - a justice which\nover-arches every struggle and\ncampaign which African people have\nwaged to assert their human dignity.\nFor the iniquities perpetrated against\nAfrican people today - whether in\nSouth Africa by the apartheid regime,\nin Mozambique and Angola by\nterroristic forms of destabilization, in\nBritain and the USA by racist attacks\nand by systems of discrimination -\nare the continuing consequences,\nthe damages as lawyers would say,\nflowing from the 400-years-long\natrocity of the slave system.\nFor me as a lawyer it is essential to\nlocate the claim for Reparations\nwithin a framework of law and\njustice. If this were merely an appeal\nto the conscience of the white world,\nit would be misconceived. For while\nthere have been many committed\nindividuals and movements of\nsolidarity in the white world, its\npolitical and economic power centres\nhave evidenced a ruthless lack of\nconscience when it comes to Black\nand African peoples.ms\nBut in my experience progress has\nbeen made when the powers that\nFor example, it used to be perfectly\nlegal in Britain, only 25 years ago, for\nnotices which said \"VACANCIES -\nNO COLOUREDS\". Today any\nemployer who discriminates on racial\ngrounds can be required by a\nTribunal to pay compensation.d\nAt an international level, apartheid in\nSouth Africa used to be regarded as\nan internal affair, however\nregrettable. But over the years\napartheid became recognized as a\ncrime against humanity and a threat\nto peace, so that international\nsanctions could be imposed.\nThis is not to say that the\nachievement of legal sanctions\"\nbrings automatic justice. This has not\nhappened either in Britain or South\nAfrica. But these examples show that\nthe demand for justice and legality is\nan essential element in the struggle\nfor a just cause.\nSo it is with the claim for\nReparations. Indeed, once you\naccept, as I do, the truth of three\npropositions:-\n(a) that the mass kidnap and\nenslavement of Africans was\nthe most wicked criminal on\nenterprise in recorded human\nhistory,\n(b) that no compensation was\never paid by any of the\nperpetrators to any of\nthe sufferers, and\n(c) that the consequences of the\ncrime continue to be massive,\nboth in terms of the enrichment\nof the descendants of the\nperpetrators, and in terms of\nthe impoverishment of Africa\nand the descendants of\nAfricans,\nthen the justice of the claim for\nReparations is proved beyond\nreasonable doubt.\nTo those who may say, that that is all\nvery true in theory, but that in\npractice there is no mechanism to\nenforce the claim, or no willingness\nof the white world to recognize it, I\nwould answer with a latin legal\nmaxim: ubi jus, ibi remedium: where\nthere is a right, there must be a\nremedy. An injustice without a\nremedy is abhorred by lawyers like a\nvacuum is abhorred by nature. Once\nthe claim is well-founded in legal\nprinciple, and well-recognized by the\ninternational community, remedies\nand mechanisms will be found.\nEven so, given the unique, massive\nand multi-faceted nature of the claim,\ninternational jurists will be needed\nwho can show corresponding\ncreativity and imagination.\nInternational law has never been\nstatic. New structures have often\nbeen devised to give effect to\nrecognized principles. The\nNuremberg War Crimes Tribunal is\nan example of new legal thinking\nwhich brought a measure of justice\nfollowing the atrocities of Nazism.\nThe International Court of Justice,\nwhere states could settle disputes\nwith each other by law rather than by\nwar, was unknown at the start of this\ncentury.\nThis paper is an attempt to\nconceptualize a legal framework for\nthe formulation and prosecution of\nthe claim for Reparations. It is urged\nby reference to to seven fundamental\npropositions.\nii",
            "1. THE ENSLAVEMENT\nOF AFRICANS WAS A CRIME\nAGAINST HUMANITY\nT\nwords:\nhe Charter of the Nuremberg\nTribunal defined crimes\nagainst humanity in these\nMurder, extermination,\nenslavement, deportation, and\nother inhumane acts\ncommitted against any civilian\npopulation... whether or not\nin violation of the domestic law of\nthe country where perpetrated.\nThe Charter also gave jurisdiction to\nthe Tribunal to try crimes against\nPeace ('planning, preparation,\ninitiation or waging of a war of\naggression...), and War Crimes\n('violation of the laws and customs of\nwar... including murder, ill-treatment,\nor deportation to slave labour or for\nany other purpose of civilian\npopulations of or in occupied\nterritory..')\nIt is considered by international\nlawyers that the Nuremberg charter\ndid not create new law, but declared\nand confirmed concepts of\ninternational criminality which have\nbeen accepted over centuries. As\none writer puts it:\nThe tribunal found that acts so\nreprehensible as to offend the\nconscience of mankind, directed\nagainst civilian populations, are\ncrimes in international Law,\n(D.P. O'Connell, International Law\nfor Students).\nIn 1948 the United Nations promoted\nthe Convention on the Prevention\nand Punishment of the Crime of\nGenocide. It has been ratified by\nmost countries in the world. Again,\nthe Convention was giving a new\nlegal form to an old concept in\ninternational law. The preamble to\nthe Convention recognized that\n\"genocide is a crime against e\ninternational law\", and that \"at all\nperiods of history genocide has\ninflicted great losses on humanity\".\nGenocide was defined:\nGenocide means any of the\nfollowing acts committed with intent\nto destroy, in whole or in part, a\nnational, ethnical, racial or religious\ngroup, as such:\n(a) Killing members of the group;\n(b) Causing serious bodily or\nmental harm to members of\nthe group\n(c) Deliberately inflicting on the\nMa group conditions of life\ncalculated to bring about its\nphysical destruction in whole\nor in part...\nHistorians and other experts can\nshow without difficulty how the\ninvasion of African territories, the\nmass capture of Africans, the horrors\nof the middle passage, the\nchattelization of Africans in the\nAmericas, the extermination of the\nlanguage and culture of the\ntransported Africans, constituted\nviolations of all these international\nlaws.\nThe arguments that such crimes\nwere 'legal' under European law, and\naccepted as normal by most\nEuropeans, would be unavailing\nEuropeans did not, then or now,\nconstitute all mankind, and the\nconscience of all decent mankind\nmust always have been outraged by\nthe atrocities which Europeans\ninflicted on Africans for over 400\nyears.\nIndeed it can be said that it was the\nultimate crime against humanity, to\ndeny human status to a vast section\nof humankind.\n2. INTERNATIONAL LAW\nRECOGNIZES THAT THOSE WHO\nCOMMIT CRIMES AGAINST\nHUMANITY MUST MAKE\nREPARATION\nT\nhe right to reparation is well\nrecognized in international\nlaw. it has been defined\nby\nthe Permanent Court of International\nJustice (the predecessor of the\nInternational Court of Justice) in\nthese terms:\nThe essential principle contained\nin the actual notion of an illegal act\n- a principle which seems to be\nestablished by international\npractice and in particular by the\ndecisions of arbitral tribunals - is\nthat reparation must, as far as\npossible, wipe out all the\nconsequences of the illegal act\nand reestablish the situation which\nwould, in all probability, have\nexisted if that act had not be\ncommitted. Restitution in kind or, if\nthis is not possible, payment of a\nsum corresponding to the value\nwhich a restitution in kind\nwould bear; the award, if need be,\nof damages for loss sustained\nwhich would not be covered by\nrestitution in kind or payment in\nplace of it - such are the principles\nwhich should serve to determine,\nthe amount of compensation due\nfor an act contrary to international\nlaw. (Chorzow Factory Case,\nGermany v Poland, 1928)\nThe leading textbook on international\nlaw by Schwarzenberger described\nthe recognition of the right to\nreparation as a process:\nInternational judicial institutions\nhave slowly groped their way\ntowards the articulate formulation\nof the rule that the commission of\nan international tort (wrong) entails\nthe duty to make reparations.\n1",
            "Most of the case law on reparations\nconcerns the compensation for\nspecific losses, such as the\ndestruction of property, buildings,\nships etc. but the principle is just as\nvalid in the case of illegal actions on\na larger scale which affect whole\npeoples. Indeed there are direct\nprecedents for the payments of\nreparations in such cases:\nIn 1952, the Federal Republic of\nGermany reached agreement\nwith Israel for the payment of\n$822 million, following a claim\nby Israel which was limited to the\ncosts of resettling 500,000 Jews\nwho had fled from Nazi\ncontrolled countries. Much later,\nin 1990, Austria made payments\ntotalling $25 million to survivors\nof the Jewish holocaust.\n• A number of agreements have\nbeen made under the British\nForeign Compensation Act of\n1950; lump sum settlements\nwere made by Bulgaria,\nPoland, Hungary, Egypt and\nRumania, and a Tribunal was set\nup\nto make awards from the\nsums made available, so as to\ndo justice as between many\nthousands of claimants whose\nproperty had been expropriated.\nA US-Iran Claims Tribunal was\nset up in 1981 for a similar\npurpose.\nJapan has made reparation\npayments to South Korea for\nacts committed during the period\nof invasion and occupation of\nKorea by Japan.\n• Most recently, the United Nations\nSecurity Council has passed a\nresolution, binding in\ninternational law, requiring Iraq\nto pay reparations for its\ninvasion of Kuwait.\nIt is therefore clear that the concept\nof reparations is firmly established\nand actively pursued by states, on\nbehalf of their injured nationals,\nagainst other wrongdoing states.\nIn addition, one can identify a second\ncategory of reparations which is of\ngreat relevance. This is where a\nstate has accepted the responsibility\nto make restitution, not just to other\nstates, but to groups of people within\nits own borders whose rights had\nbeen violated.\n• In 1988 the United States\nCongress passed the Civil\nLiberties Act, which was\ndesigned to make restitution to\nJapanese Americans in respect\nof losses brought about by \"any\ndiscriminatory act the US\nGovernment... based upon\nthe individual's Japanese\nancestry\" during the wartime\nperiod when Japanese\nAmericans were interned in great\nnumbers. A Commission was\nset up to investigate claims. A\ntotal of $1.2 billion, or about\n$20,000 for each claimant, was\npaid. The Act began by stating\nthe basis for reparations in clear\nterms which could be applied\nwith the greatest relevance to the\nclaims of African peoples:\n\"The purposes of the this Act are to:\n(1) acknowledge the fundamental\ninjustice of the evacuation,\nrelocation and internment of\nUS citizens and permanent\nresident aliens of Japanese\nancestry during World War II.\n(2) apologize on behalf of the\nDe people of the US...\n(4) make restitution to those\nindividuals of Japanese\nancestry who were interned...\n(7) make more credible and\nsincere any declaration of\nconcern by the US over\nviolations of human rights\ncommitted by other nations\".\n⚫ Similar provision was made for\nrestitution to the Aleut residents\nof various Alaskan islands \"in\nsettlement of US obligations in\nequity and at law, for injustices\nsuffered and unreasonable\nhardships endured while those\nAleut residents were under US\ncontrol\".\n• Some steps have been taken to\nrecognize the rights to restitution\nof indigenous peoples whose\nland was plundered and\noccupied, and whose people\nwere decimated, especially in the\nUnites States, Canada, New\nZealand and Australia. Each of\nthese countries have made land\nrights settlements and/or\nfinancial payments to indigenous\npeoples. These are woefully\ninadequate gestures, given the\natrocities committed in those\ncountries against indigenous\npeoples. But they recognize that\nthe surviving generations of\nindigenous peoples have the\nrights to a measure of reparation\nfor the crimes committed against\ntheir ancestors.\n3. THERE IS NO LEGAL BARRIER\nTO PREVENT THOSE WHO STILL\nSUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES OF\nCRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY\nFROM CLAIMING REPARATIONS,\nEVEN THOUGH THE CRIMES\nWERE COMMITTED AGAINST\nTHEIR ANCESTORS\nW\nhether the descendants of\nthe immediate victims of a\ncrime have a right to\nreparations will depend on the nature\nof the claim being made. The US\npayments to Japanese Americans\nwere aimed at making restitution for\nthe suffering of those actually\ninterned. The Austrian payment was\n2",
            "to survivors of the concentration\ncamps, again to make reparation for\nthe physical and mental agony of\nthe concentration camps. If a victim\ndied before the claims were agreed,\nhis claim died with him, since the\npain and suffering were personal to\nhim.\nBut there are many cases where\nthe consequences of the crime\ncommitted are visited upon\ndescendants. Where property has\nbeen expropriated, the loss is\nsuffered not merely by the then\nowner, but also by his descendants\nwho have lost an inheritance which\nwould otherwise have been theirs. In\nsuch cases, international law gives a\nremedy, even if the claimant was not\nborn at the time of the expropriation.\nFor example, the Order made under\nthe British Foreign Compensation Act\nof 1950 provided that the Foreign\nCompensation Commission should\ntreat as established any claim\nrelating to certain property in Egypt\nwhich had been sequestrated by the\nNasser government if the applicant\nwas the owner or is the successor in\ntitle of such owner, making it plain\nthat the children and the\ngrandchildren of the original\ndispossessed owners were entitled\nto claim.\nMore recently, since the unification of\nGermany, claims have been pressed\nsuccessfully by the sons and\ndaughters of property owners whose\nlands were seized after the German\nDemocratic Republic was set up. No\none doubts their rights to claim, even\nthough they may have been children,\nor even unborn, when their family's\nlands were taken over.\nClaims have been made not only by\ndescendants, but by the nation-state\nwhich has had to bear the burden of\npaying for the consequences of the\ncrime. As noted above, Israel\nsuccessfully claimed reparations\nfrom West Germany for the costs of\nresettling Jewish refugees - even\nthough the state of Israel did not\nexist at the time when the Nazi\nregime committed its crimes against\nthe Jews. It is also significant that\nWest Germany, which felt obliged to\nmeet the claim. was also a different\nstate, territorially as well as\npolitically, from the German Reich\nwhich was responsible for the\natrocities.\nIn principle, therefore, the passage of\ntime since slavery ended is no barrier\nto the claims of African peoples,\nprovided that it can be proved that\nthe consequence of the crime of\nslavery continue to manifest\nthemselves to the prejudice of\nAfricans now living in Africa and the\nDiaspora. On the point, the evidence\nof historical experts is clear and\nunequivocal.\nOn the African continent, flourishing\ncivilizations were destroyed; ordered\nsystems of government were broken\nup; millions of citizens were forcibly\nremoved; and a pattern of poverty\nand underdevelopment directly\nresulted, which now affects nearly\nevery resident of Africa. In the\nAmericas, the slavery system gave\nrise to poverty, landlessness,\nunderdevelopment, as well as to the\ncrushing of culture and languages,\nthe loss of identity, the inculcation of\ninferiority among Black people, and\nthe indoctrination of whites into a\nracist mind set - all of which continue\nto this day to affect the prospects\nand quality of Black people's lives in\nthe Caribbean, USA, Canada and\nEurope.\nWhile there is no limitation period in\ninternational law, unreasonable delay\ncould be a reason for refusing a\nclaim. A state which had a just claim,\nbut which failed to advance it over a\nlong period, could be held to have\nacquiesced in the wrong or to waived\nits right to claim reparations.\nHowever, no objection along these\nlines could properly be made against\nthe claim of Africa and Africans in the\nDiaspora. In the case of Africa and\nthe Caribbean region, the period of\nslavery and the slave trade was\nfollowed by the period of colonialism.\nIt can be urged that colonialism itself\nwas a crime in international law, for it\nwas a usurpation, imposed by force,\nof the rights of the colonized\npeoples to their sovereignty. It was at\nthe very least a crime against peace,\nand in most if not all colonized\nterritories, crimes against humanity\nwere frequently committed. In the\ncase of the United States, former\nslaves were subjected to a system of\nexclusion, separate development,\nracial persecution, civil rights denials\nand ghettoization, which has only in\npart been overcome in the recent\nyears following the civil rights\nhe civil rights\nmovement.\nThe important point is that African\npeoples, until recently, had no\nindependent voice, nor even any\nstatus in the world community. How\ncould the people of, say Ghana or\nJamaica make a claim for\nreparations when their country was\nconsidered to be an 'overseas\npossession' of the very country\nwhose people had kidnapped and\nenslaved their ancestors?. Still less\nwere African-Americans, as they\nstruggled for the right to be\nrecognized as citizens, in any\nposition to make any claims - even if\nthere was any international forum in\nwhich a claim could be brought,\nwhich there was not.\n3",
            "Even after the independence of\nAfricans nations from colonialism,\nthe shackles of neo-colonialism have\nfettered the power of African\ngovernments to speak with any real\nindependence for a claim for\nreparations to be voiced. Indeed I\nwould argue that now, as never\nbefore, is the right time for this claim\nto be made, as African leaders are\nspeaking with a new confidence and\noperating new democratic structures.\n4. THE CLAIM WOULD BE\nBROUGHT ON BEHALF OF ALL\nI do not hold any such defeatist view.\nOnce the first three propositions are\naccepted as valid, and the right to\nreparations is seen to be soundly\nestablished in international law, then\nways of doing justice can and will be\nfound. Difficulties of scale or\nprocedures should not be obstacles\nto justice. The unwillingness of the\nwhite world to consider the claim is\nnot a reason for giving it up, but\nrather a spur to mobilizing\nawareness and support around the\nissues.\nHowever, in addressing these\nAFRICANS, IN AFRICA AND IN THE questions I seek to identify the\nDIASPORA, WHO SUFFER THE\nCONSEQUENCES OF THE CRIME,\nTHROUGH THE AGENCY\nOF AN APPROPRIATE\nREPRESENTATIVE BODY\neru\nS\no far I have been dealing with\nthe legal basis for the\nreparations claim. The next\nfour sections deal with questions\nwhich a legal analyst is bound to\nraise, however difficult it is to answer\nthem:\nWho are to be the Plaintiffs, or\nclaimants for reparations?\nWho are to be the Defendants\nagainst whom the claim is made?\nWhat are the damages to be\nclaimed?\nIn what Court is the claim to be\nbrought?\nang\nHere we sail into unchartered\nwaters, since no claim for\nreparations of this magnitude has\never been brought. Hundreds of\nmillions of people, in different\ncontinents of the world, have an\ninterest in this claim. Their losses\nmay seem almost impossible to\nquantity. Some minds are so\ndaunted by the practical problems\ninvolved that they conclude that the\nclaim is unrealistic.\nprinciples involved, rather than to\nfurnish precise answers, which can\nonly be developed over time and\nexperience, and after deep study.\nWho are the claimants for\nreparations? The broad answer is\nthat all Africans, on the Continent of\nAfrica and in the Diaspora, who\nsuffer the consequences of the crime\nof mass kidnap and enslavement,\nhave an interest in this claim.\nAll Africans around the world have\nbeen affected in some way by the\ncrime of slavery. Even those who\nhave succeeded in a business or a\nprofession have had to face racial\nprejudice at the least. And while\nthere may be some whose families\nenriched themselves by collaboration\nwith the slavers, that should not be\nallowed to undermine the overall\ntruth that the rape of Africa\nimpoverished all Africans, both those\nwho were taken and those who were\nleft behind.\nWho should process the claim on\nbehalf of so many? This is a matter\nwhich transcends national\ngovernments - but governments are\nthe chief implementers of social\nprogrammes, as well as being\nresponsible for the repayments of\ntheir country's foreign debt. They\nshould neither be excluded from, nor\nhave sole control over, the\nprosecution of the claim. In any\ncase, African-Americans, African\nBritish, French Africans, and others\nwho are in a minority in the country\nwhere they have settled, have no\ngovernment which could speak for\nthem.\nSome form of appropriate,\nrepresentative and trustworthy body\nwill be required; its size and\ncomposition, and the mechanisms\nfor setting it up, will become clearer\nas the movement for reparations\ndevelops.\n5. THE CLAIM WOULD BE\nBROUGHT AGAINST THE\nGOVERNMENTS OF THOSE\nCOUNTRIES WHICH PROMOTED\nAND WERE ENRICHED BY THE\nAFRICAN SLAVE TRADE AND THE\nINSTITUTION OF SLAVERY\nW\nho is responsible for\npaying reparations? Here\nit is more appropriate to\nconcentrate on the Governments of\nthe countries which fostered and\nsupported the slave trade, which\nlegitimized the institution of slavery,\nand which have profited as a result.\nIt would be possible to identify\nindividual companies which could be\nproved to have made vast profits\nfrom slavery. There are plantation\nowners in Jamaica, and titled\nfamilies in England, whose living\nheirs owe their wealth to slaving.\nShould such companies and families\nbe targeted as individual Defendants\nto a reparations claim?\nIn my view such an approach would\n4",
            "create more problems than it solved.\nEnormous research would be\nneeded to identify the companies\nand families, to determine how much\nmoney was made by their ancestors,\nand to calculate how much should be\nforfeited by the present shareholders\nor family members. The process\nwold inevitably be somewhat\narbitrary, and potentially oppressive,\nand it would be rejected both by the\ntargets themselves and their\ngovernments.\nI would however make one\nexception: When it can be proved\nthat a work of art or an artifact, now\nin a public or private collection, was\noriginally obtained illegally in the\ncourse of an invasion or plundering\nexercise in Africa. In this one case,\nthe international law concept of\nrestitution in kind could be applied.\nThe reparation process must include\nthe restoration of identifiable\ntreasures to the country which most\nclosely represents the people from\nwhom they were robbed.\nIn reality in these cases of\nrestitution, the individual owner\nwould lose the work of art, but would\nmost probably receive compensation\nfor its value from his own\ngovernment. This is because the\nrestitution would have been made\nwith the co-operation of the relevant\nEuropean or other government; and\nit is a normal principle that\ncompensation must be paid when\nprivate property is taken away by the\nact of a government.\nThe reason why the 'Defendants' to\nthe reparations claim should be\ngovernments, is that it is\ngovernments which have some\nmeasure of control over their\nnational wealth, through their\nreserves and their taxation powers; it\nis governments who must in the end\nbe persuaded that reparations are to\nbe paid as a matter of justice; it is\ngovernments who can determine\nwhether Africa's debt burden should\nbe unladen from its shoulders; and it\nis governments which are\nresponsible for making international\ntreaties and implementing them\nthrough the passage of laws.\nHistorians will advise as to which\ncountries have profited most from\nslavery and the slave trade. The\nmajor European maritime trading\nnations and colonizers can be easily\nidentified. So can the United States,\nas a country which grew rich on\nslave labour and the exploitation of\nAfrican Americans. However, as the\nnext section indicates, the NT\nassessment and evaluation of\nresponsibility will be a vast\nundertaking.\n6. THE AMOUNT OF THE CLAIM\nWOULD BE ASSESSED BY\nEXPERTS IN EACH ASPECT OF\nLIFE, AND IN EACH REGION,\nAFFECTED BY THE INSTITUTION\nOF SLAVERY\nT\nhe assessment of what\nshould be claimed is perhaps\nthe most pressing and\nonerous task to be faced by the\nreparations movement. Each wied\naffected country will have be studied,\nand perhaps even each people with\neach country. Different\nconsiderations will apply to the\npeoples of the African continent; the\npeoples of the now independent\ncountries where slavery flourished,\nand the people who are minorities in\nEurope or North America.\nThe damage may be classified and\nresearched under different headings.\nThere is economic damage, cultural\ndamage, social damage,\npsychological damage. To put\nmonetary figures on any of the\nelements of the claim raises\nquestions to which there are no easy\nanswers: how do you assess the\nvalue of the loss to Africa millions of\nyoung people kidnapped and\ntransported over 200 years ago?\nWhat figure can be placed on the\npsychological damage inflicted by a\nsystem which is still deeply racist?\nCan it be proved that the slave\nsystem destroyed old and flourishing\nAfrican civilizations, and if so, how is\ntheir value to be measured? What\nlevel of restitution is appropriate for\nthe African peoples of the Diaspora?\nAnother approach, perhaps to be\nadopted in parallel, is to measure the\namount by which various European\nnations were directly enriched by the\ninstitution of slavery. In the Report of\nthe Inquiry into Racism in Liverpool,\nwhich I conducted in 1989, I quoted\nthe historian Ramsay Muir, who\nwrote in 1907. He described the\nslave trade as \"the pride of\nLiverpool\", for it flooded the town\nwith wealth.\nwhich invigorated every industry,\nprovided the capital for docks,\nenriched and employed the mills of\nLancashire, and afforded the\nmeans of opening out new and\never new lines of trade. Beyond a\ndoubt it was the slave trade which\nraised Liverpool from a struggling\nport to be one of the richest and\nmost prosperous trading centres in\nthe world.\nSimilar evidence could be uncovered\nabout Bristol, London, Bordeaux,\nand many others ports.\nOther questions arise as to the\nmanifold components of a\n5",

THE CLAIM IF NOT SETTLED BY\ncombination of the following could be AGREEMENT WOULD ULTIMATELY\nincluded:\n- an apology made by the Queen\nand other heads of state to\nAfricans world wide;\nthe cancellation of debt, on the\nbasis that Europe owes far more\nto Africa and the Caribbean than\nAfrica and the Caribbean owes\nto Europe.\n- crash programmes of\ndevelopment in the inner cities\nwhere African descendants\nsuffer the consequences of\ninstitutionalized racism.\n- programmes to build the\ninfrastructure of the African\ncontinent, once a land of well-\ndeveloped trading networks.\n- repatriation for diaspora Africans\nwho wish to return to the\ncontinent from which their\nancestors were taken.\nFortunately there are many seekers\nafter truth who are trying to find\nanswers to all these questions\nthrough careful research. Any figures\nput on the various elements of the\nreparations claim will at best be\nestimates made from a basis of\nsound historical research. However\nthe research process itself will have\na value far beyond of the calculation\nof figures. It will be an educative\nprocess through which the horrors of\nthe past will be re-examined. The\nmore the details of the slave system\nand its consequences are exposed,\nthe more understanding there will be,\namong African people and white, of\nthe justice of the reparations claim.\ngmoo blonam\nBE DETERMINED BY A SPECIAL\nINTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL\nRECOGNIZED BY ALL PARTIES\nT\nhere is at present no court\nwhich would be competent to\nhear a claim for Reparations\nfor Africa and Africans in the\nDiaspora. The International Court of\nJustice is competent to hear claims\nby one state against another for\nbreaches of international law. But\nthis claim is on a much vaster scale\nthan a claim between states. It would\nneed a new mechanism,\ncommensurate with the unique and\nmassive issues of which I have\nspoken.\nThe absence of a court is no\nimpediment to the Reparations claim.\nIn the examples given earlier, the\nlegitimacy of the claim was\nrecognized and embodied in an\nagreement, without there having\nbeen any pre-existing tribunal to deal\nwith the grievance. As part of the\nagreement a mechanism for dealing\nwith individual claims was\nestablished. The nature of the court\nwhich makes the binding decisions\nwill depend on the issues at stake\nand the negotiations which have\npreceded the agreement.\nboe\nFor example, the agreement made\nbetween Iran and the United States\nfor the payments of reparations set\nup a nine-member Commission,\nconsisting of three American judges,\nthree Iranian, and three from\ncountries not involved in the dispute.\nIt sat in three chambers of three\njudges, and made adjudications on\nnearly four thousand claims.\nAt this stage, therefore, it is\npremature to consider the\ncomposition of any Commission or\nTribunal which might ultimately\nadjudicate upon the African\nReparations Claim. The adjudicating\nbody will only carry authority if it has\nbeen set up with the concurrence of\nall parties to the dispute. The\ninternational recognition of the justice\nof the claim is a condition precedent\nto the setting up of any judicial\nmachinery.\nThis, then is the great task in which\nlawyers have a specific but mo\nsignificant contribution to make. They\nare only a small part of the panoply\nof forces which will be needed -\nhistorians, archaeologists, artists,\nwriters, politicians, sociologists,\npsychologists, and beyond them all,\npeople of good will, of all races, who\nperceive that the crime of slavery\nwas a monstrous evil, for which\natonement and reparation is long\noverdue.\nbucts rblaew lanoben\n60",
            "FACTS\non Reparations to Africa and Africans\nin the Diaspora\nREPRINTED BY PERMISSION OF THE HON. DUDLEY THOMPSON OJ QC RAPPORTEUR TO THE GROUP OF EMINENT PERSONS ON REPARATIONS\n1. What is Reparations about?\nThere is an abundance of proof that\nAfrica was the cradle of civilization.\nCenturies before the birth of Christ,\nthe stories of the Queen of Sheba\nand her visits to King Solomon, with\nan organised retinue and also the\narchitectural wonders of the\npyramids are clear evidence of the\nheight to which African civilization\nhad reached. Further the ancient\nkingdoms of Africa like those of\nSonghai, Benin, Ghana and others\nwere highly organized and even\nancient universities like Timbuktu\nexisted. At this time Europe was very\nunderdeveloped and America had\nnot even been discovered. This\ndevelopment of Africa was\ninterrupted sometime around the\n14th century by the heinous\ninstitution of slavery. This robbed\nAfrica of her best and strongest men,\nwomen and children who were put in\nchains and were exported like goods\nand chattels - like goats and pigs to\nthe Islands of the Caribbean, United\nStates, Brazil and elsewhere. These\nslaves worked under very hard\nconditions, planting sugar cane, and\ncotton for their masters' enrichment\nand this prevented for centuries the\ndevelopment of their own countries\nin Africa. The results of their work as\nslaves was to enrich the countries of\ntheir masters. Those countries\nbecame rich and developed, while\nAfrica, the homes of the slaves,\nremained poor.\nReparations which comes from the\nword 'repair' is a Movement which\nseeks to identify and redress those\nwrongs, so that the countries and\npeople that suffered will enjoy full\nfreedom to continue their own\ndevelopment on more equal terms.\n2. How do you intend to go about\nit?\nThere is a Sub-Committee which\nwas appointed after the first\nInternational Conference on\nReparations in Lagos, Nigeria in\nDecember, 1990. This Committee\nhas advanced the cause to the\nnational level and President Ibrahim\nBabangida advanced it further to the\nplatform of the OAU which in June,\n1992 empanelled a Group of\nEminent Persons (GEP) to work out\nthe different ways in which to\nproceed, and to secure technical\nadvisers who will help to solve some\nof the problems raised by this claim.\nThis Group also hopes to make this\ncause known to the peoples of the\nworld in a quest for justice. This\ninformation is being passed to you\nnow through this publication and\nothers to follow.\nthe demand on the agenda of the\nUnited Nations, as it has now been\nsupported by the OAU.\n4. Why are we asking so late?\nto abmuong\nThis is not late for the following\nreasons:\n(i) There is no law of limitations\nwhich limits claims for murder and\ngenocide, such as was involved in\nslavery;\n(ii) Further, when slavery was\nabolished in the 1830s, it was\nsucceeded by colonialism. This did\nnot abolish exploitation of the\ncolonies, it was merely a\ntransformation from one subjugation\nto another. Colonialism ended for\nmost of us only 30 years ago and in\nfact this still exists in some colonies.\nAs colonies, we could not speak for\nourselves, as we were not free to do\nso. Since the abolition of colonialism\njust 30 years ago, we are free to\nspeak and are asking you to join us.\nThirty years is not a long time on the\npages of history.\nIt is the failure of development in\nAfrica over the last 30 years that has\n3. Who is asking for Reparations? underlined the extent to which slave\nThe Group of Eminent Persons on\nReparations for slavery, operating\nunder the umbrella of the OAU, is a\nstructured body consisting of people\nwith international reputations and is\nnot restricted to one race, sex or\nreligion. They are acting on behalf of\nthe black peoples of the world, and\nwe expect soon to be able to place\ntrade, colonialism and neo-\ncolonialism have remained as\nshackles that need to be removed if\nwe are to be free to pursue\ndevelopment.\n5. From whom are we asking for\nReparations?\nAll those countries and peoples who\n7",
            "we can prove unjustly benefitted\nfrom carrying on slavery and other\nforms of unjust exploitation will be\nasked to make Reparations to those\nwho suffered.\n6. Is the demand for Reparations\nanother way of asking for foreign\naid?\nNo. The demand for foreign aid is\nbeing made by some governments.\non the grounds of compassion. We\nare asking for reparations on the\ngrounds of justice and equity.\n7. Have we got any authentic\nevidence on which we can base\nthat claim?\nThere exists evidence in writing,\nletters, bills of sales, in some cases\ndetails such as the names of slave\nships, buyers and sellers. There is of\ncourse the existence of artifacts\ntaken away from the colonies now in\nthe metropolitan countries and other\nbits of evidence from which the\nclaims can be made out. But we are\nalso working on further\nsubstantiating these claims; And\nBA\nthere is still a lot of work to be done.\n8. Is there any precedent?\nThere is a list of precedents to this\ntype of claim. Let us mention a few.\nThe State of Israel receives millions\nevery year from Germany as\nReparations for the suffering of Jews\nunder the Nazi oppression during the\nholocaust. The Koreans received\nReparations from the Japanese for\nthe cruelties perpetrated upon them.\nThere is in fact still a claim\noutstanding with regard to Korea's\n'Comfort Women'. The Indians\nreceived compensation from the\nUnited States. And Iraq was ordered\nto pay Reparation to Kuwait, the\nrichest country on earth. for or A\ndamages. There are others.\n9. Are we asking for money?\nThis claim goes far beyond a request\nfor payment in monetary terms. We\ncannot evaluate the price of\nhundreds of thousands of lives and\neven more for human\ndehumanization, shame and\nsuffering. We are asking for an\nacknowledgement by those enriched\nfrom slavery and colonialism of their\nguilt in this respect, a confession of\ntheir complicity, an apology, and the\nnatural consequences of all these\ninclude monetary compensation.\n10. Is this a race question?\nNo. This a question of justice and\nthere are people on both sides of the\ncolour line who support our cause.\n11. How much money are we\nasking for?\nAs stated above, money is not the\nmain objective but certain payments\nneed to be made, to build\nuniversities, roads, houses, and to\ntransfer technology, et cetera. A\nspecial Committee is already working\nout details based upon the actual\nlosses and what will get Africa and\npeoples of African descent moving\nagain. Such payments will also relate\nsimilar to payments and other\nprecedences of reparations such as\nthose made to Kuwait, Israel et\ncetera.\n12. Is there any legal base to\nsupport the present demand?\nOur case is based on morality and\nequity, but it also supported in\ninternational law. There is a principle\nin law known as unjust enrichment: if\none party becomes enriched as a\nresult of a wrong done to another\nparty, the law compels the former to\nmake an adjustment to the latter.\nThere are in various Conventions,\nsuch as the Geneva Conventions or\nthe Human Rights Convenants, of\nthe United Nations, clearly laid down\nprohibitions against the denial of\nhuman rights.\nThis is not a matter which\nnecessarily has to be taken before\nordinary courts of law. The\nconscience of the world is a peoples'\ntribunal, and it would certainly give\nsupport to the experts pursuing this\nmatter.\n13. Should the present\ngenerations be held responsible\nfor the wrong doings of their\nancestors?\nWe are not to penalize the present\ngenerations who are descendants of\nslave-owners and slave-traders.\nWhat we put before the world is the\nfact that certain countries today and\ncertain sections of the present\ngeneration are placed in a better\nposition, economically, politically and\nsocially than the claimants, as a\nresult of the unjust enrichment\nenjoyed by their ancestors at the\nexpense of claimants.\n14. Is the aid already paid to\nAfrica not enough to settle claim?\nNot at all. Even if foreign aid is\naccepted as part of the returns form\nthe western world, the total\ninvestment is still only an\ninfinitesimal part of the value of what\nthey have extracted from Africa, and\nfrom the enforced labour of peoples\nof African descent.\n15. How do we ensure that any\nrepayments do not end up in\nprivate pockets?\nThe Group of Eminent Persons will\nensure full accountability in every\nrespect. Furthermore, much of the\nReparations will not be in terms of\n8",
            "cash but in technical transfer from\nthe develop to the underdeveloped\nworld, scholarships, the\nestablishment of universities,\ninfrastructural development, seats on\nthe Board in the Conference rooms\nwhere decisions are made affecting\nmatters like plans of trade et cetera.\nThe programme for rehabilitation,\nreconstruction, and establishment of\na new world order will not be the\naffair of individual person or\ngovernments.\n16. Some people have argued\nthat slavery and colonialism have\ncontributed to the development of\nAfricans. Is this true?\nподае\nThis is palpably not true. Those who\nsay that Africans who have\nadvanced have done so because\nslavery put them in a 'conducive\natmosphere' to advance should visit\nthe slave relics like the Isle of Goree,\nElmina Castle, Badagry and other\nmonuments to the infamous trade to\nunderstand how wrong they are.\nThose that advanced as in the\nCaribbean, United States and\nelsewhere, did so by the Will of God,\nand in spite of the slave conditions -\ncertainly not because of them. The\nstruggle of the black slaves is an\nepic worthy to be remembered. It is\nthe story of a people who fought\nback under the most difficult\nconditions trying to climb the ladder\nof progress. Reparations is an\nattempt to give their descendants\nsome assistance in climbing that\nladder so as to reduce the odds\nagainst them. Struggle is a part of\nour culture and the ascent from\nslavery to our present position is a\nsource of pride. The struggle\ncontinues.\n17. Why do you relate colonialism\nto slavery?\nIt is most important for us to grasp\nthe linkage. The Atlantic slave trade\nused European capital to take\nAfrican salves to the New World.\nWith abolition, European capital\nturned its attention to the exploitation\nof African labour, land and mineral\nresources in Africa itself. The Atlantic\nslave trade had identified slavery\nsolely with the black person,\nperpetually in a degraded and\ndehumanized position. Colonialism in\nAfrica was based on the racial\nfoundations laid by the Atlantic slave\ntrade. Because the world failed to\nrecognize the inhuman slave trade\nas a crime against humanity,\nEuropean powers went in to commit\nequally heinous crimes against\nAfricans under colonialism.\n(Remember Leopold's Congo, and\nthe German war against the\nHereros). Even after nominal\nindependence had been granted,\nwith African human and material\nresources already depleted by the\nslave trade and colonialism, the\nWestern world continues to control\nAfrican economies and to manipulate\nits governments for their own ends.\nThey bear a lot of responsibility for\nthe increasing degradation, collapse\nof states, hunger, disease and\ngloomy prospects.\n18. Since the Africans at home\nwere not enslaved, why should\nthey ask for Reparations?\nThey are asking for reparations for\ntwo reasons.\nslave trade has been racial\nprejudice. Arabs enslaved not only\nblacks, but also whites and\nsometimes other Arabs. They\nsometimes inter-married with black\nslaves and thus there was no\noutright prejudice against all black\npeople during the earlier period of\nthe slave trade. In the case of the\nAtlantic trade, however, all the slave\nmasters were white and the slaves\nblack; and this has given rise to the\nheinous practice of looking down on\nblack people. All Africans suffered\nfrom this, whether they were\nenslaved or not. This was the\nfoundation of colonialism and neo-\ncolonialism in Africa. Prejudice\nagainst black people spread almost\nevery where in the world and we\nhave to redress this problem. The\ncost of this world-wide prejudicere\nagainst black peoples in incalculable.\nIt is revealed in such incidents as the\nLos Angeles riots, and it is beginning\nto show itself in some parts of\nGermany, Britain and France. It is\neven said to exist in Mauritania and\nother parts of Africa; thus the\nvinu\npsychological damage is one of the\nthings we have to redress.\n19. What can I do to help this\ncrusade?\nWe should hope, having read this\nthat you will feel it is your duty to ved\nstand up for the rights of all black\npeople. To respect your own leaders,\nto spread the story of the crusade\nand the facts in this paper, but above\nall, to support your country as a great\nblack country of which you are\nproud. You should never measure\n(a) The effects of the slave trade\nwas not felt by the immediate victims\nonly but by all black peoples. The\nimpact on Africa in the loss of\npeople, destruction of agriculture and yourselves against any other\ntrade, insecurity of life, social\ndegradation etc. was disastrous and\nno black people, even those who\nparticipated in the trade could\nescape its destructive\nconsequences.\n(b) One of the effects of Atlantic\n9\nstandards and not consider our work,\nour people, and our products as\ninferior to that of others. Try and\norganize to teach the young people\nespecially, what is in this paper so\nthat we can make the world a better\nplace.",

The Conference reflected the fact that the desire for\nchange, and the willingness to effect it burns deep in all our\nhearts.\nAt least one hundred people attended the conference, but it was\ndisappointing to note that there was no one from Cardiff, Bristol\nor Liverpool. To that extent the conference did not quite achieve\nit's purpose.\nIt was also a rather low key affair,\nheld as it was in the\nheld as\nCouncil\nChamber\nat Birmingham.\nIt did\nnot\ngenerate\nthe\nenthusiasm and energy that previous meetings had and this was in\npart due to the setting.\nIt is clear that much action is need to create and generate\nmomentum if reparations are to be won, and to this extent it is\nclear that the role of the Steering Committee must be more action\norientated with less emphasis on talking.\nWe need to be more professional and dynamic, more pro-active than\nwe have previously been, we must set the agenda and not merely\nfollow someone else's. It must be acknowledged that the sub-\ncommittees have not all functioned and that to rely upon this\nmechanism is to inhibit the ability of the organisation to\ndevelop. As a matter of urgency we need a constitution so that\nwe have a formal basis to conduct our business.\ned\nLetters of interest continue to pour into Bernie's office, phone\ncalls requesting speakers etc, and we need to act on these as",

Amongst the\nthings that need to be done is a concretising of the ideas that\nhave been expressed by the Steering Committee, for example to\ndraw in Sports and Entertainment personalities for both money and\nsupport, people like Lennox Lewis and Viv Richards. That means\nthat someone has to volunteer to do this.\nThere is also a need to offer a newsletter to the Movement so\nthat people feel in touch with what is happening. And we need to\nmake things happen. For example publicity stunts such as a picket\nof the British Museum, a series of Press Briefings so that the\nissue of reparations is carried by a variety of news media. If\nfaxened.\nwe do this and make sure that our address is placed in the text\nwe will recruit more interested African people.\nI\nWe also need to pursue our ideas about getting our message across\nin schools and colleges by a concerted campaign.\naq\n31\naware\nwar\nThe offer of office accommodation from chief Abiola is still\nbeing pursued, although we are\nthat he has his own\ndifficulties at the moment, but it is clear that Bernie's office\nwill not be able to contain the expanding work that will need to\nbe done if we are to make reparations happen.\nSV\noler\nWe therefore need an office and we need volunteers to staff it, eveb\nthis would be more realistic that hoping for paid staff, with\nall of the attendant management issues.

What things do we\nneed to change, both in the world and in ourselves, if we are to\naccomplish the mission of reparations? What changes must we make\nin structures, in psychology, in historical consciousness and much\nbeidelse?\ned\nare\nWe might begin by noting that Blacks are not the only people\nin the world who are seeking, or who have sought, reparations.

Others were the social cost of war, as represented by\nthe burden from loss of life, social disorder, and institutional\ndisorder; and the economic cost of war, as represented by the\ncapital destroyed and the value of civilian goods and services\nforegone to make war goods. Payments were made in cash and kind\ngoods, services, capital equipment, land, farm and forest products;\nand penalties were added for late deliveries.\nPerhaps the most famous case of reparations was that paid by\nGermany to the Jews. These were paid by West Germany to Israel for\ncrimes against Jews in territories controlled by Hitler's Germany,\nand to individuals to indemnify them for persecution. In the\ninitial phase, these included $2 billion to make amends to victims\nof Nazi persecution; $952 million in personal indemnities; $35.70\nper month per inmate of concentration camps; pensions for the\nsurvivors of victims; $820 million to Israel to resettle 50,000\nbas pr Jewish emigrants from lands formerly controlled by Hitler.

We cannot hope to\nchange the world without changing our ways of seeing the world, our\nways of thinking about the world, our ways of organizing our world,\nour ways of working and dreaming in our world. All these, and\nmore, must change for the better. The type of Black Man and Black\nWoman that was made by the holocaust -- - that was made to feel\ninferior by slavery and then was steeped in colonial attitudes and\nvalues that type of Black will not be able to bring the post-\nreparation global order into being without changing profoundly in\nthe process that has begun; that type of Black will not be even\nappropriate for the post-reparation global order unless thoroughly\nand suitably reconstructed. So, reparation, like charity, must\nbegin with ourselves, with the making of the new Black person, with\nthe making of a new Black World. How?\nJuode\n26\nend\nandi\n--\nWe must begin by asking ourselves: What weaknesses on our\nside made the holocaust possible? Weaknesses of organization?\nWeaknesses of solidarity?

We must recognize that in 36 years of independence,\nreckoning from Ghana's in 1957 (just four years short of the 40\nyears the Israelites spent in the wilderness!), we have been\nblundering about in the neo-colonial wilderness. And we must ask:\nWhy did Moses lead his people into the wilderness and keep them\nwandering about for two generations? I do not believe that he, a\nlearned man raised in the pharaoh's court, did not know the direct\nroute to his people's Promised Land. I believe it was a dilatory\nsojourn whose tribulations were calculated to cure his people of\nthe legacy of slavery. You can't make a free people out of slaves\nwithout first putting them through experiences that would purge\nthem of the slave mentality.

In that way, when we\n17\n--\nfinally arrive at our own Promised Land a Black World cured of\nthe holocaust legacy we would be ready for the new liberated\nphase of our long adventure on this Earth.\nTo help us get our bearings in this wilderness phase, I would\nsuggest four main measures:\n1.\nanellim\nThe creation of Holocaust Monuments in all parts of the Black\nWorld, as reminders of what we have been through and are determined\nnever again to go through. Efforts already being made in this area\nshould continue and be added to. I am thinking, for instance, of\nthe Goree Island Project in Senegal, and the Slave Route Project in\nBenin Republic. But let me recommend a major monument here in\nAbuja, this new capital rising in a zone that, in the past,\nwitnessed intensive slave raiding for the trans-Sahara slave trade.\nWe should erect here a monument complex that portrays scenes from\nthe Black Holocaust, scenes taken from all parts of the world; a\ngreat Black Holocaust\nBlack Holocaust Monument that shall serve as the Black",

The institution of a Holocaust Memorial Day, to be observed\neach year throughout the Black World, as a day of mourning and\nremembrance, with solemn ceremonies at local holocaust monuments.\nPerhaps this date, April 27, on which we have assembled here,\nsebne should be designated the Holocaust Memorial Day of the Black World.\n90\ndeed\nmed\ne\na\n3.\nThe creation of a Black Heritage Education Curriculum, to\nteach us our true history, and thereby restore our self-worth as\ndescendants of the pioneers of world civilization, and supply us\nwith the antidote to the White Supremacist Ideology and its\ndamaging effects. This would produce a post-holocaust Black\npersonality, one cured of the debilities inflicted by the holocaust\nexperience.\nto sigo 4. The creation of a Black World League of Nations, with its\ncomplex of institutions, to take care of our collective security,\nto foster solidarity and prosperity among us, and to prevent the\nbeen infliction of any future damage on any part of the Black World.\n-002 B\nThese measures, and others like them, would teach us who we\nare, what we have been and ought to become, and would promote and\nto be concretize Black World solidarity.

            "We are not here talking about money alone, but the legacy of\nenslavement and colonialism on us and on the Caribbean and\nAfrica.

Neither are\nhistory but one that lives on in the attitudes and responses to\nblack people of African origin in Britain.\n80 101 Busol\nIt may prove easier for the British Government to agree to make\npayment for slavery and colonialism than it will be to get an\napology because in many quarters of British society the view that\nthey did us a favour\"\nwe as Africans are inferior and that\nstill runs deep within the culture and fabric of Britain.\n\"\n032\nто\nThat is why we must mount a massive and all embracing campaign\nfor reparations because to do so strikes at the very heart of\nracist mythology. We will no longer be at the receiving end of\npaltry handouts, what we demand is justice and repair for real\ndamage inflicted. This is a campaign to lift the heads and the\nspirits of all African peoples in which we take the initiative.\nThe legal precedents already exist. We have seen the United\nNations demand and obtain reparations from Iraq for it's invasion\nof Kuwait, and before that we saw the Federal Republic of Germany\npay reparations to Jews who suffered at the hands of the Nazis.\nThere already exists a body to spearhead the campaign in Britain,\nbut what is now\nlinked to the Organisation of African Unity\nrequired is that this campaign is grounded firmly within the\ngrass-roots African communities in Britain.\nThat is why we have organised this first conference for\nactivists. It will not have reached everyone, but it is our hope\nthat by organising a working conference for a small number we\nwill have a well informed debate within our wider community.\n10\nIf we had reliable means of communicating with each other it\nwould not be necessary to exclude anyone at this formative stage,\nbut we are aware that there is currently much misunderstanding\nabout what reparations are and what it could mean. So by having\na small gathering to share information we may have the basis for\nthat wider debate. blow dw ynom\nbas bi\nD\nThe case for reparations that needs to be developed must consider\nall aspects of the case. We as a planning group do not intend to\ndictate to our community exactly what shape the case should take,\nthat is a matter for the whole community to determine. That is\nwhy we have organised workshops to explore the range of options.\nopen to us.\nno al\nTo mi exs dow to\nFrom our focused and informed discussions we will be able to go\nback to our existing organisations or set up new ones to spread\nthe word within our communities and add to the campaign outside\nit.\nWe are convinced that the campaign for reparations is the means\nto address racism in Britain and elsewhere against people of\nAfrican origin. By researching and documenting the case of the\nsystematic exploitation and appropriation of Africa and Africans\nwe provide for ourselves an argument that is about justice and\nequity. It is an issue that goes to the core of racism. What we\nwill show by our campaign is that the ways that we have been\nviewed as Africans is fundamental wrong. But we will not be\nasking for charity or tolerance, we are demanding justice. This\nfor once puts us on the offensive rather than the defensive.\nThe ends we\nwe seek of financial compensation for slavery and\ncolonialism are important, but we must also see the means by\nwhich we achieve those ends as equally important.\nThis must be a campaign that involves and includes all people of\nAfrican origin, it will not be undertaken by any self-appointed\nleaders. Democracy and participation must be the methods of our\nactions. Our past attempts to forge a united movement have\nfoundered when we have made unreasonable demands on those who\nassume leadership positions. This time therefore we will need to\nmake formal demands and be explicit about them so that we\nhold elected leaders to account.\nThis conference is part of an explicit process of involvement\nfor all Africans. Starting here, we have knowledge, and we\nrecognise that knowledge is power. We must share our knowledge.\nand we must seek more. We must share our skills and experience\nso that together we build a movement for justice and equality\nthat is worthy of the name.\nIn the past some of us have tended towards a degree of self-\ncriticism which has been destructive. Whilst we must rightly\ncontinue to look critically out our each and every action, it is\nessential that we rid ourselves of the negativism that has been\nthe product of racism about ourselves as Africans. We are not our\nown worst enemies as I heard one brother say at a recent meeting.\nOur enemies are those with power who seek to deny us our\nexpression and our identities.\nThere are real differences between us, ones that have in the past\nbrought us dissent and disagreement. We cannot ignore the\ndifferences nor should we but we must learn the lessons of the\npast. If this movement is to be successful it must not be\ndogmatic. None of us has a monopoly of what it means to be\nAfrican. Our experience within the Diaspora has demanded that we\nadopt appropriate strategies for our survival. Some of us have,\nespecially in recent years become religious. We are Muslims,\nChristians and Jews, some of us have developed religions that are\nmodelled upon ancient African traditions, and some of us are\ndeeply suspicious of all organised religion. What is clear\nhowever is that unless we accept the pluralism of our faiths we\nshall flounder as countless brother and sisters have done before\nus.\n2\n3",
            "Our African origins were plural, they were diverse, and this\nMovement must understand that we must develop means of accepting\nour differences in the traditions\nand honouring\napreceded us.\nthat have\nIn reality there are many ways that African peoples in the\nDiaspora express and organise ourselves, some of these ways react\nto and reflect the racism we face, some are more successful than\nothers. If we are to move forward as a people we are charged with\nthe responsibility of finding ways of negotiating those real\ndifferences, without putting each other down or name calling. How\nfor example will we handle situations in which African brothers\nand sisters decline to call themselves African but prefer instead\nthe term, black British ? If we accuse them of having a slave\nmentality will we be likely to get them to take pride in their\nheritage and identities ? No, we must put energy into persuading\nthem of our point of view rather than condemning them. If we do\nbenot do this we will be a movement of like-minded people but not\na movement which includes all African people.\nIt is important that we clarify our relation ship with people of\nAsian origin because this issue will be exploited by those who\nhave long practised divide and rule. In organising as Africans\nmany of us will continue to work closely with Asian peoples\naround our shared experience of racism in Britain. But we have\nea right and a duty to work on our own specific experience to the\nextent that it is distinct form that of Asian people. The theft\nof our peoples and our languages marks the African experience as\ndifferent from that which occurred for others. It would be a\nfruitless and meaningless competition to try to measure who's\nexperience was the worst. It is sufficient for us to say that we\ndemand justice for what has happened to us and in doing so we do\nnot deny the justice that others many also demand.\nnesd and\nanded\nAn issue that has arisen on the speaking tour that Bernie Grant\nhas conducted has been what should our relationship be with white\nand this is\nthat\nquestion\nhas important\nsupporters,\nimplications at this stage of our movement. It must be addressed\nhere and now.\na\ned asɔne\nOur movement must be by for and about African people of that\nthere must be no doubt or ambiguity. To succeed we must persuade\nea significant section of white British society of the justice of\nour case. Not all of us will want to be engaged in that task,\nmany of us because of past experience will not work closely white\ngroups again. But others such as myself do see the need to win\nthe support of elements in the Labour Party, the Churches and\nothers with influence. This does not mean that there should be\na direct role for white people within our Movement, but it does\nrecognise that there will be those who have a role, one that is\nIt would be a\nclearly outside our movement but informed by it.\ngrave error to seek support from white people before our African\nautonomous movement is established. But equally it would be a\ngrave error to think we can succeed entirely on our own.\n4\nIn the spirit of the pluralism referred to above we may have to\n10hold both positions that of an African only organisation and also\n03\nworking with\nwith sympathetic white people. We will not be\ncompromised so long as white people remain outside our movement.\nIf they are truly sympathetic they will understand why we must\norganise this ourselves.dmmo\nOne of the many manifestations of the impact and legacy of racism\non African peoples are the ways that we have become so deeply\nsuspicious and critical of each other. It is easy to bad-mouth\nanother brother or sister by calling them an Uncle Tom or a\ncoconut, but in some ways the even more damaging aspect of our\nsuspicion is to assume that others are not to be trusted with the\nsame integrity that we ourselves possess. I am thinking here of\nthe suspicion that\ntowards black professionals, or\ned academics. It is as though they are not to be trusted because\nthey work in the \"white man's world\". Where this view exists it\nA often assumes that the prevailing eurocentric ideology is\nuncontested, when in reality the opposite is the case.\nbeth\nexists\nI have myself been wondering who benefits from this belief, since\nJudit\nit is evident that in cutting of black professionals and\nbacademics from the grass roots of our communities they are less\nable to serve the whole of our community. But I also know that\nwhatever the suspicions that exist about those working in the\n\"mainstream\" there is a pride and a satisfaction from much of the\nI work they do. For example the black social workers in the early\n80's who critiqued the impact of transracial fostering and\nas adoption of black children put facts where our anecdotes existed.\n_\nThe black teachers and academics who went into the institutions\nthat under-valued and sought to destroy us blew the whistle on\nwhat we knew was happening to our children.\nThe question that is uppermost in my mind on this artificial\ndivide is a strategic one. Who can we bridge the divide in a way\nthat brings in and strengthens the work being done by isolated\nblack professionals without allowing them\ndominate the\nMovement.\nto\nIt is an important question because it is clear to anyone who has\nlooked at the history of past black struggles that we need to\nconduct our campaign on a broad front. We need activists and\norganisers, and we need historians and lawyers. We need research\nnot only into the legal case for reparations but the documentary\nproof of the involvement of individuals and companies in slavery.\nAnd in the search for this information in the towns and cities\nof Britain all of our community will need to be involved. The\nskilled academic researchers will need to share their knowledge\nof research techniques with us so that we can go to the libraries\nand companies to get the evidence we need to make our claim.\nMargaret Thatcher in the early 1980's made clear her intention\nto promote a black bourgeois, to some extent she may have\n5",
            "succeeded but at this juncture of our struggle we should not\ngallow her achieve her purpose. By creating a strong movement for\nreparations we have the means of providing support and focus to\nthose black people who are placed in the mainstream, so that\ntheir energies are directed as far as possible on work that is\nto the benefit of the African community.\n15\nThe question of leadership is one that is often raised within our\ncommunities, we have suffered in the past from self-appointed,\nor worse, white appointed leaders. There should be no automatic\nɓ assumption that anyone, because of their current position will\nautomatically assume a leadership position within our movement.\nProfessionals will not automatically lead, neither will men\nto automatically lead women. This must be a movement that values and\nrespects our different but equal contribution to the struggle.\nIt follows therefore that a formal and explicit means must be\nadopted to select our leadership. For it is clear that we need\nleadership now more than ever. But we have fallen out and down\nin the past on not looking at our mechanisms. It is as though we\nhave relied entirely on the rightness of our cause and neglected\nso to consider the means of achieving our aims. This time therefore\nbwe must elect leaders and they should reflect not one view but\nee the range of views that exist within our community. They should\ntogether compliment each others skills and attributes and they\nmust be made accountable to us once elected.\nede bur\nwe\nmay\nIt is from this process of developing a structure\nbestablish ways of working which are inclusive of all, or at least\nmost African peoples. It will necessarily be a learning process.\nfor all of us. Many of us have spoken with passion about the\nimplication of the reparations campaign, we know that if it is\nsuccessful as we believe that it will be, it will not only\nno transform those of us engaged within it, but it will transform\nAfrica and the Caribbean. Many of us have no doubt that we would\nnot be happy to see some of the corrupt and backward (ie. Western\nI supported) leaders continue to misrule. And if many of us are\nto go or return to Africa and the Caribbean to rebuild, we must\nbetake with us skills that will be of practical use. Amongst those\nskills and maybe foremost amongst those skills will be our\norganisational and professional qualities.\nas The justice of our cause is evident, but we must turn our clarity\nand unity into action. The intellectual effort of all of our\nb people will be a crucial part of that campaign. For example what\nA economic relationship should exist between Africa and the\nDiaspora ? What would Pan-Africanism be like in practical reality\nat an economic level? How do we create sustainable growth and\nhave the benefits of Western technology? These are profound\nissues that need to be considered alongside our claim for\nepreparations. We do not wished to be surprised or overwhelmed with\nour success in achieving reparations by not preparing for it.\nen\nSo the case for reparations will require skills and expertise\nthat few of us at present possess. If we can cast aside our\nno learned suspicions of each other we will learn and share so that\nev together we may grow.\n6\nJaum aquoip dua ba\nde\n999 phies eda yd bevoaggs\nOur relationship with the press is also an issue which must be\nconsidered now. There are many of us who are rightly cynical\nabout the press, even the black press, the Voice for example has\ndone our movement few favours. But it is also the case that many\nblack people especially in areas of small communities continue\nto rely upon the newspapers as the only means of being in touch\nbo with other black people. It is against this background that our\nen relationship with publicity has to be considered.\nspol bas\nWe need to use the media and in doing so we recognise that it\nwill never be accurate or honest, but use of the press must be\nan means to an end and not an end in itself. The press however\ninaccurate provides opportunities to argue our case to black\npeople who might otherwise not hear us. It is from the press that\nmany people contacted Bernie Grant to find more information about\nthe reparations issue and this a lesson to be learned by the more\npurist amongst us who would refrain from using the press. Our\nYA movement should not insist that everyone must use the press but\nneither should it insist that none of us does so. For the build\na mass movement of African people we must reach all of them, and\nto 900m\neven negative publicity enables us to make contacts.\nOur external relations within Britain will be of strategic\n10 importance to us, they have the potential to divide us because\nad of our different approaches to achieving our goals. If we are to\nsucceed it is essential that we find means of holding the range\nof approaches that exist within our community.\nOur external relationships with Continental Africa and the\nDiaspora will need to be developed so that we grow apace with\nInternational developments. That we are placed in the heart of\nthe Imperialism and neo-colonialism will be of significance to\nthe Movement as a whole. We owe it to our brothers and sisters\nin Africa and the Caribbean to play our part in this historical\nMovement.\nSo far this campaign has attracted the support and enthusiasm of\nAfrican peoples politically active in a range of campaigns and\nactivities. No one means has thus far proved successful despite\nthe efforts of countless committed African activists so we must\nmove forward drawing from our past experiences of achievement\nwith optimism and realism.\nRecommendations to be considered by Conference.\n1. That the Africa Reparations Movement ARM (UK) is an\norganisation open only to people of African origin.\n2. That ARM (UK) should\nshould form a structure which reflects the\nbreadth and depth of the African community in Britain.\n3. That ARM (UK) is Pan-Africanist in it's outlook.\n4. That local groups should be set up which have constitutions\n87",
            "approved by the Steering Committee, and that such groups must\ned affiliate to ARM (UK) if they are to be recognised.\na5. That ARM (UK) develop close working relationships with the\nInternational Movement for reparations sponsored by the\neu Organisation for African Unity.\n6. That the steering committee will be replaced by elected\nrepresentatives by no later than November 1994, and that the\nsteering committee and local groups will prepare the ground for\nthe adoption of a Constitution and structure by that date,\nincluding the planning of the Inaugaral Annual General Meeting\nof ARM (UK) open to all people of African origin.\n7. That nominations for executive positions will be open only to\nindividuals nominated by affilitiated groups by the 31st May\n1994, elections to take place at the AGM\n8. That the work of the Movement in Britain will be on many\nb levels including academic research, outreach within our\nbr communities, public speaking, letter writing etc, and that no one\nmode of activity is deemed more important than any other.\n9. That the movement will aim to be inclusive of all people of\nAfrican origin and will therefore try muster the support of\nbo prominent African personalities such as those involved in sports\nand the entertainment field as well as those who currently\ndescribe themselves as \"black British\".\n10. That the financing of the Movement will come primarily from\nwithin the Movement.\n11. That the Movement will be pluralist and democratic and that\nwe shall learn from the range of approaches to reparations which\nI have been developed over the years.\nJuods bas za eno remevom a oni sebi na mzola\nbvod\nnellA\nsexps of sealed eiqmaxe roles Inmolizio\nAction Plan\n.noliuliano sol s\n803\n日\nDecember 1993 20 xemons of noisia navip ever ow\n891\nBriefing for Activists\nno themevom add not ada\nReturn to groups, spread\nroots.\nJanuary 1994\never epada air dis bas pa\nprins consnii Illw sw sidiaaog\ninformation about reparations to grass\neixem e\n02eas da ov\nTUO no Joaqui Jobs sved IIw themevom strid mida roW SW WOR\nSeries of local meetings- formal groups set up.\nsop\naodaiw odw napaob\nA to enoyns ebg\nEstablish network, probably London to coordinate information and\ncampaign (newsletter?). an\nabnaija saor los eszme od loss to yd\nFebruary 94 bhoo ad os bean fllwi\n03\nII w spurt ei\nspurt ei au soled de\nexuper llwyll as vllsmolzen vllsool, level\nLocal Groups undertake local research using public records of\ninvolvement with slavery, which Industries, factories were based\nproduce from the \"colonies\" in 17th, 18th and 19th\ncenturies.

I remember being at a Black commu-\nnity conference in the early seventies, when a resolu-\ntion was put demanding reparations for all people of\nAfrican descent. Then, as now, it was not just a\ndemand for money, but for a recognition of the injus-\ntices, the indignities and the brutality experienced by\npeople of African descent, throughout slavery and\ncolonialism and in present times under neo-colonial-\nism and racism\nAfrican\nemigration. Time was spent in concentration camps\nbecause of racial, religious and political persecution.\nOther burdens were caused by loss of life of family\nmembers and sometimes whole communities, as well\nas social and institutional disorder. There was also the\neconomic cost of war, value of civilian goods and ser-\nvices lost because of the war. Payments have been\nmade to individuals, institutions and states, in cash\nand kind, goods and services, capital equipment, land\nfarm and forest products. All of the above terms could\napply to African peoples and their terrible experiences\nthroughout the centuries.\nReparations\nReparations was an issue when Britain\nabolished slavery. The then British\nparliament voted £20 million com-\npensation to be paid to the Slaves\nOwners, but not a penny for those\nwho had been slaves. Owners of\nslaves in Brazil were also rewarded.\nIn the United States, at the time of eman-\ncipation in the 1860's each freed slave was\npromised 40 acres and a mule'. The\npromise was not kept. In New York in 1969,\nJames Foreman of the Students Non-Violent\nCoordination Committee, called upon the white\nchurches to pay $500 million in reparation for slav-\nery and racism. That demand has been ignored. In\n1989 the Congressional Black Caucus instituted a bill\nin the US Congress for Reparations. This was unsuc\ncessful. Clearly a new strategy was needed if African\npeoples were to be successful in their righteous\ndemands.\nResearch has been done into the success of other\ngroups of oppressed peoples in seeking and obtaining\nreparations. Japanese Americans were successful in\nobtaining compensation from the US government for\nthe victimisation they experienced during World War\nII (WWII). The US Government paid reparations to\nthe government of Colombia because they excised the\nterritory of Panama from that country. There are also\nclaims in the pipelines by the Sioux Peoples to the\nBlack Lands of Dakota, as well as by other native\nAmerican groups, against the US govemment.\nAfter the First World War. German liability for the\ndamage they caused, was fixed at 132 billion gold.\nmarks. Following WWII, the European Allies filed\nclaims against Germany for $320 billion. Italy and\nFinland have also had claims made against them for\nthe same period. The basis of these claims were that,\nas a result of the wartime activities of these countries\nthere was: bodily loss, loss of liberty and of property,\ninjury to professional careers, dislocation and forced\nWest Germany has made large reparations\nto the Jewish people, e.g. it has paid to\nIsrael $2 billion to make amends to\nvictims of Nazi persecution, $952 mil-\nlion in personal indemnities, $37.70 in\nmonthly pensions to each inmate of a\nconcentration camp. Israel was given\n$820 million to settle 50.000 Jewish\nemigrants from lands formerly con-\ntrolled by Hitler. Since then more has\nbeen given to individuals and institu-\ntions. The latest being S63 million to\n50,000 Jewish people from East Germany.\nThese may be large sums of money but they\ncan never fully replace the suffering and losses\nexperienced by millions of Jews during World War II.\nIn recent cases Iraq had to pay reparations for its inva-\nsion of Kuwait. A few years ago land and money was\nmade over to some of the Maori people of New\nZealand, as well as a formal and public apology by\nQueen Elizabeth 1, for past deeds. There are other\nsteps being taken to restore to other native peoples in\nCanada and Australia, their land and wealth which\nwas plundered. There has been recent publicity about\nthe plight of Aborigine people who were forcibly\nremoved from their families and put out to adoption to\nwhite families. They are to sue the Australian govern-\nment. In relation to art and cultural objects, there are\nmany demands being made by European governments\nfor the return of significant items which were stolen\nby other Europeans. The Elgin Marbles in the British\nMuseum are a case in point. A recent dispute has\narisen about the Trojan Treasure currently on display\nin Moscow. The Germans claim it as theirs, and was\nStolen by the Russian Army when they defeated the\nGermans after WWII. The Greek govemment has now\nstepped in to claim the treasure as it was stolen by a\nGerman who dug it up in the last century.\nThe right to reparations has strong legal underpinning\nand was recognised in international law as far back as\n07/05 '99 09:24\nTX/RX NO. 3427\nP03\n04",

All of\nthese precedents provide a basis for people in Africa\nand the African diaspora to begin to develop the struc-\ntures which will enable them to mount the necessary\nclaims. Developments are already taking place to\nexpedite these.\nAt a meeting of the Organisation of African Unity\n(OAU) held in Nigeria in December 1991, the OAU\nendorsed and adopted the 'crusade for reparations'\nfrom those countries involved in the enslavement and\ncolonisation of African peoples. A Group of Eminent\nPersons (GEP) were enpannelled at the Dakar summit\nof the OAU in 1992. Their task is to continuously\nmonitor the issue, to take action and advise. The First\nPan-African Conference on Reparations, sponsored by\nM.K.O. Abiola and hosted by the Nigerian govern-\nment, was held in Abuja in 1993. In attendance were\ndelegates from thirty African countries, members\nfrom the Diplomatic Corps of European countries.\nScholars, journalists and representatives from major\norganisations in the African diaspora met to discuss\nand co-ordinate 'a Pan-African Crusade' to demand\n'reparations for enslavement, colonisation and neo-\ncolonialism', and to carry it into every area of intera-\ntional politics. The conference endorsed and adopted a\ndeclaration to take the issue forward (see Abuja\nDeclaration at the end of article).\nBernie Grant MP, was invited to the conference and\nreturned to the UK. determined to raise the issue here.\nHe called together a group of like-minded people.\nThis led to the setting up of the African Reparations\nMovement UK (ARM, UK). The organisation con-\nvened a national conference in Birmingham in 1994..\nThe ARM UK has since been consolidating its posi-\ntion, developing a constitution and creating a strategy.\nThere is a now a small committee of founder mem-\nbers. A body of sponsors of national and international-\nly known figures is being assembled, and financial\nbacking is being sought.\nIn 1993, Bernie Grant also put down a motion in the\nHouse of Commons, which was signed by 85 mem-\nbers of parliament. In March 1996, Lord Gifford\nopened a debate in the House of Lords, which gave\nfurther publicity to the issue. There is also a site on\nthe internet, the address is:\nhttp://the.arc.co.uk/arm/home.html.\nThis has elicited tremendous interest world-wide and\nthousands of enquiries are pouring into Bemie Grant's\noffice.\nCharles Wootton News\nWe as African people need to have a complete under-\nstanding of our history if we are to undersand why we\nare owed reparations. how we assess the damages.\ncount the costs and identify those responsible.\nChinwezu, an author as well as the editor and publish-\ner of Black Renaissance, and a member of the GEP,\ndates the beginning of the destruction of Africa from\nthe 'millennia before 525BC, when Black Egypt fell\npermanently to white invaders'. leaving Africa open\nto continuous invasion since. A pre-requisite to resti-\ntution must be 'apologies for ancient wrongs', from\nall those countries responsible for the African holo-\ncaust. An example of what is meant by reparations is\nthe cancellation of debts which have developed in\nAfrican states since independence. These should have\nbeen gifts from the very beginning. The spiralling\ndebt burdens are strangling the development in those\ncountries, e.g. Uganda spends 17 dollars per person on\ndebt for every 3 dollars it is able to spend on health.\nZambia spent 37 million dollars on primary education\nfrom 1990 to 1993. while it spent 1.3 million dollars\non debt repayment. One African health official said.\nevery time World Bank people visit our country hun-\ndreds more of our children die. Cancelling all debts\nand interest on those debts has to be the beginning of\nreparations. Dudley Thompson, a Jamaican QC, states\nthat it is not too late for reparations to be made to\nAfrican peoples, as there is no law of limitations\non murder and genocide'. Reparations must not only\nbe to the people and states of Africa but also to those\npeople of African descent in the Diaspora.\nReparations means also that we must rehabilitate our-\nselves, only then can we make a real contribution to\nthe future of African peoples.\nReference\nThe meaning of African Reparations by Dr Kimani\nNehusi.

K. O. Abiola addressed an African-American\nworkshop under the auspices of the Black Caucus of the United States Congress. He did so\nin his capacity as Patron of the Caucus. The theme of his address was \"Reparations to\nAfricans in the Motherland and in the Diaspora\". It was not the first time that the subject was\nbroached. It had been mentioned and even dwelt upon in the course of many Pan-Africanist\ncrusades. But Bashorun Abiola's presentation on that occasion was different.\nAt the end of his address, there were such unprecedented emotional scenes as to make\nthe spontaneous ovation that greeted it the longest in the history of any gathering of the\nUnited States Congressional Black Caucus. There and then instant volunteers emerged\npledging to assist in the global distribution of copies of the speech to as far and wide as was\npossible. In Nigeria, the speech was so well received that many newspapers gave generous\nspace to it.\nThe time of these publications coincided with the period of activities marking the 10th\nAnniversary of the founding of the Concord Press of Nigeria Limited, publishers of the\nConcord Group of Newspapers and Magazines. To round up activities marking the\nanniversary, a world Conference with the same theme, that is \"Reparations to Africa and\nAfricans in the Diaspora\" was arranged. It was held at the Nigerian Institute of International\nAffairs in Lagos on 13th and 14th December 1990, but not without its problems. Apart from\nthe time constraint which limited consultation, the occupation of Kuwait by Iraqi forces\nadversely affected the conference. The occupation robbed the gathering of the contribution\nof eminent law makers from Britain and the United States who had accepted invitations to\nparticipate but who had to serve, at that point in time, on important legislative committees\non the Kuwaiti-Iraqi crisis.\nNevertheless, the overall turnout was very good. The conference drew resource\npersons from the national and international academia, black groups from the British House\nof Commons and the United States Congress, the High Commissions of the West Indies in\nNigeria, some black activist groups as well as labour. The opening was impressive, the\nsessions well attended, and deliberations at all levels serious and well articulated. The\nkeynote address by President Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida which was delivered on his behalf\nby Vice-president Augustus Aikhomu has since become an important reference on the issue\nof reparations to Africans. The serious deliberations led to the important communique which\nhas formed the basis for the continuation of further work on the matter.\n1",
            "Specifically, the conference mandated a select committee headed by Bashorun M. K.\nO. Abiola to map out strategies for realizing the dreams of reparations. In this connection,\nBashorun Abiola has undertaken visits with an entourage to Britain, the United States and\nBrazil talking to groups with the objective of effecting reparations and exploring ways of\nestablishing similar bodies where non existed. At the same time, some governments both in\nand outside Africa have been penetrated for support on the realization of the goal of\nreparations.

This trilogy of slave trade, colonialism and neo-colonialism has caused\nirreparable damage to the continent and its people, be they in Africa or in the diaspora. The\ntrade in slaves involved the transportation of the \"fittest and the best of Africa's sons and\ndaughters\" to Europe, the Caribbean and the Americas. This trade in human beings had\nseveral devastating consequences for Africa and Africans. For those who were transported,\nthe trade in slaves resulted in the loss of their language, their culture and a severance of\nfamily ties. In addition, they were deprived of their human rights and, perhaps most\nimportantly, the opportunity to develop themselves. The consequences were the lot of those\nwho survived the arduous journey. Many paid the supreme price. For the continent itself,\nthe consequences were no less devastating. Slavery led to a depletion of the virile manpower\nrequired for the development of the continent, it led to slave wars and the destruction of the\nsolidarity among its people. This probably facilitated the colonial penetration and conquest\nof the continent.\nпо be\nST\nrn\nThe trade in slave, it must be emphasized, was not only immoral, it was also\ncriminal, hence illegal. This criminality continued in colonialism. African lands\nthe form of\nwere expropriated, the treasures of Africa were looted, the agricultural and mineral resources\nof the continent were expropriated to support the industrial revolution in Europe, and the\nAfrican human resources were used in wars that did not concern them. These atrocities did\nnot end with colonialism, they are being perpetrated and refined in the modern form of\nslavery known as neo-colonialism. The criminal factor that links slave trade, colonialism and\nadf\nneo-colonialism provides the justification for the demand for reparations.\nПо по\nof to suis Ovasontent\n2\n3",
            "Reparations simply means compensations made for damage done to a state or people\nby another state. There is no doubt that tremendous damage has been done to Africa and its\npeople in and outside the continent by the trilogy. Justice demands that the monstrous damage\nbe:\nAcknowledged;\n1.\n2.\nAtoned for, and\n3.\nRedressed.\nFurthermore, there is an urgent need for the present generation of Africans and people of\nAfrican descent to be compensated. History is replete with precedence of reparations.\nNotable among these are:\novala mitof\n1.\n<-001\n2.\nbos\nwoq\n3.\n4.\n510\nAfter WW I, defeated Germany was asked to pay 132 billions marks as\nreparations;\nlos yd bewollo\nFollowing the Second WW, Germany continues to pay the state of Israel\nreparations for the holocaust perpetrated on the Jews by Hitler, while\nJapanese-Americans received reparations for the persecution and internment\nthey suffered at the beginning of the war;\nThe United States, Canada and Australia have all paid token reparations to the\nindigenous inhabitants of their territories who were murdered and expropriated\nduring and after colonization;\nMore recently, the United Nations passed a resolution that Iraq must pay repa\nrations for the invasion and destruction of Kuwait. Reparations, which include\nacknowledgement, atonement and recompense is vital to enable Africa and\npeople of African descent to break out of the vicious circle of economic under\ndevelopment and the psychological complex of inferiority.\nThe demand for reparations is not based on sentiment or on the morality of our case.\nNor should it be construed as a request for aid from Europe and America. The demand is\nbased on the legal right to compensate a people for what the international community must\naccept as crime committed.\nTo make the perpetrators of this crime accept responsibility for the damage done will\nnot be an easy task. Questions are bound to be raised about two or three main issues;\nbas meileignas\nFirst, the legal status of the act at the time the crime was committed; second, the\nretroactive nature of our demand, and thirdly the competence of the present generation of\nAfricans to demand reparations as well as the culpability of the present generation of Europe-\nans and Americans in the crime. If for no other reason, the demand for reparations is valid\nand just because the present generation of Africans is still suffering from the impact and the\ndamage done by the trilogy of slave trade, colonialism and neo-colonialism. They have been\nsaddled with the responsibility of bearing burdens of these crimes. This is best epitomized\nin the Debt Crisis. A linkage exists between the debt crisis and the trilogy.\nγιαν\n1100 STOW\nTo realize the demand for reparation, Africans within and outside the continent, must\nenunciate a clear strategy. This strategy must be multi-dimensional. One dimension will be\ndirected at sensitizing Africans the world over on the need and justification for reparations.\nThe main thrust of this will be to create consensus and solidarity. A second dimension will\nbe directed at sensitizing the international community, particularly, the peoples and govern-\nment of Europe and America. Here we will need to emphasize that this demand is not predi-\ncated on morality but is based on legality.\nSeveral alternative fora were suggested as platform for conducting the campaign for\nreparation. One platform was the OAU, another was the creation of a Pan African body.\nThese efforts could be supported by a Think Tank comprising carefully trained specialists\nfrom among our people to act and serve as a resource base for our leaders. suns bas\nwisure\nanubiles\ndug oved aneshAshutoso xia tuoda to\nto bohs\nali to The option of utilizing existing international legal machinery such as the World Court\nand International Arbitration was mentioned, but with the caution that the case for reparations\nwould require very careful preparations.

            "Slavery and colonialism have inflicted tremendous damage on Africa and on Africans\nin the Diaspora. Millions of Africans have died in the process of implementation of these\npolicies, the African economy, culture and societies were completely devastated. For over four\nhundred and fifty years Africans were caught, manacled and shipped across the Atlantic to\ncreate wealth in other parts of the world. Those who did not die during the raids or in transit\nwere condemned to lives of servitude. The millions captured were the young and virile Afri-\ncans, the very class needed for the development of the continent. Slavery was accompanied\nand later replaced by colonialism. Many millions more died resisting to colonialism. The\ncurtailment of freedom and the disruption of the normal way of life of the Africans created\npsychological, social, economic and political problems the scars of which are still with us.\nIt is for these damages and injustices that reparation is sought.\naib ed\nHISTORICAL AND MORAL GROUNDS FOR REPARATIONS A bas squal to inam\nReparation is not new because it is at the heart of social justice. Whenever and wher-\never individuals, groups of people and nations are wronged or are victims of terrible crimes,\ncase for reparations can justly be made. History is replete with such instances.\nAfricans, more than any race of people, have been the victims of the longest crimes\nand cruelties which began from the times of slavery and still continue till today. With blood,\nsweat and tears over a period of about six centuries, Africans have put together a solid, unas-\nsailable case for reparations. A compelling moral and historical case which the rest of the\nworld is still to give a fair hearing.\nbluoy\nAfrica's case for reparations is not based on sentiments or on a single event in history.\nThe case is unique because it spans six centuries. It is based on the unequalled savagery and\nbestiality of the slave trade, the subjugation and exploitation of colonialism and the degrada-\ntion and puppet-existence of neo-colonialism. The current crisis in Africa are the consequenc-\nes of colonialism and neo-colonialism.\nScholars and Pan-Africanists at different times and at different fora have eloquently\narticulated and documented the historical case for reparations. Works by Africans at home and\nin the diaspora are painful reminders of the horrors of slavery and the injury and death of\nresisting colonial subjugation. These works provide ample historical background for the de-\nmand for reparations.\nThe consequences of the slave trade, colonialism and neo-colonialism in Africa today\ncan be summed up in one word: Underdevelopment. Many studies already exist detailing what\nthis implies. We can explore the implication of the massive loss of population which has been\nhas been likened to prolonged hemorrhage in a person, leading to severe anaemia and the\nneed for blood transfusion. We can examine the consequence of uneven exchange, economic\nexploitation and technological retardation; the undermining of the very fabric of society and\ndestruction of any sense of regional solidarity.\nThe Slave Trade\nThe world was slow to recognize the fact that the slave trade was a crime against\nhumanity. Many acts which individually were recognized as crimes in international law were\nregular features of the slave trade, for example, piracy and kidnapping. Similarly, while\nattempts continued in Europe to bring war under some international regulations, slave wars\nwere not included.\nThe notorious Middle Passage illustrated the extent of the denial of human dignity.\nEven criminals being transported to Australia were not subjected to such degradation. In the\nNew World, this denial of the humanity of black slaves was institutionalized. Eventually,\nBritain took the lead in seeking international acceptance that it is a crime to divest human\nbeing of their humanity and treat them as chattel property to be bought and sold. By that\ntime, the Atlantic slave trade had lasted four centuries. The loss to Africa, taking into ac-\ncount those who died in the wars and in transit in Africa and on the Atlantic crossing, was\nover 20 million people.\nColonialism\nThe Berlin Conference drew up plans for the partition of Africa without a single\nAfrican power being represented. Partition was regulated under international law in so far\nas it concerned the relationship between different European States; the relationship between\nthem and African peoples was outside the law. The wars of conquest, for the most part, were\ncrimes against humanity in their ruthlessness, and genocide. Atrocities in the Congo Free\nState are well documented, so also is the case against the Germans in Namibia, Tanganyika\nand the Cameroon by the allied victors at World War I.\nNeo-colonialism\nThe League of Nations began the process of bringing colonialism under international\nregulation and to show it up as a crime against humanity. The territories taken from the\nGermans were placed under a mandate system which involves some degree of international\nsupervision. The international community began to question the theory of colonialism on the\nbases of its denial of freedom, lack of opportunities, neglect of economic development and\nimpoverishment through ruthless exploitation.\n6\n7",
            "ant by European powers conceded political independence but retained control over the econo-\nmies of Africa which they integrated into the world system, placing them in a position of\ndependence. The world has so far failed to accept that neo-colonialism, like the slave trade\nand colonialism before it, is a crime against humanity; that the social, economic, and tech-\nnological divide between Africa and Europe has widened immeasurably. The international\ncommunity has so far rejected calls for a new international economic order which would have\npermitted a more just system of resource distribution.\nwsl\nalidw The call for reparations is an attempt to break through this vicious cycle. It is a search\nfor a more just international order, a redistribution of surplus funds now invested on\narmaments and the arms race. Africa needs reparations to repair the damage done to basic\ninfrastructure, education, and the entire social system.\nvlingib nou\nThe Holocaust and Africa\nvllaut The demand for reparations involves comparison between the fate of Africa and the\nholocaust. Can anything in history be compared in scale and criminality to the crime of the\nholocaust? Those directly affected by the holocaust will insist that nothing can be so com-\npared, but this is because the world has forgotten the factor of criminality contained in the\ntrilogy of the slave trade, colonialism and neo-colonialism.\nmelisinole\nsignia & Juodsi son A to noisinsq ad not analq qu womb consta aihed T\nutos ni wel lenoirement jebu boisluge woonbaino grind nowo dich\nneowind qidenoiteleradiowed ideoiales, or beco\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nMOITU 1028\nAfter exhaustive discussion and deliberation on the issues relating to reparations, the\nfollowing recommendations were made:\n1.\nThe critical issue of reparation to Africa and Africans in the diaspora should\nbe taken to the top of the agenda of international dialogue.

            "we proceed to the International Court of Justice? How can reparations be effected, and what\nshall we consider the acceptable minimum?\nMr Vice-President, Mr Chairman, the questions are many, the answers are few, and the\nobstacles are numerous. The demands for reparations may, at this early stage, appear to be\nmerely the dream of an out-of-step idealist, of some one who is not conversant with the\nincreasingly harsh realities of the complex international economic and political environment.\nSome other people who may indeed mean well, will say that this is some form of heresy, that\nwe seek to do that which has wisely not been done before. And a few others are likely to feel\nthat we are determined merely to disrupt the normal course and conduct of international\nrelations, to put blacks at war with white, to re-open wounds which are better left to heal on\ntheir own.\nWe hear all this, and we take consolation in the fact that those who do not dream do not do\nanything at all, that the first man to suggest that the world is round was also accused of\nheresy, and that all those who have dared to demand justice, including Moses, Mahatma\nGandhi, Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela, were also at one time considered to\nbe trouble makers seeking to cause social disharmony. Samuel Johnson, the notable English\nessayist, aptly captured the mood of this Conference when he said that \"Nothing will ever\nbe attempted if all possible objections must first be overcome.\" Our intentions are noble, our\ncause is just, and our methods are equitable. As always, history will offer the final verdict.\nBut even while we await the final verdict of history, we must not fail to vigorously put\nforward our case to the contemporary society. Slavery and colonialism are historical facts\nnot the figments of fertile imaginations; millions of our brothers and sisters were killed and\nour economies, our cultures and our societies were completely devastated - this is the truth,\nnot the fruit of a creative fiction writer's pen. For over five hundred years, we have been\nthe world's favourite victims, exploited by an astonishing number of nations - no one\ndisputes these facts, which have been carefully chronicled by historians.\nAll that we ask is that these wrongs be officially acknowledged as contributing substantially\nto the horrendous plight of Africans all over the world, that some gesture of atonement and\nrestitution be made to survivors of a holocaust which has gone on since the fifteenth century,\nand that a process of systematically re-integrating Africans into the world productive\neconomy be embarked upon by the international community.\nThose who say that we are committing heresy are obviously uninformed about the history of\nreparations. As the world has come to accept the principle of restitution, Germany continues\n12\nto pay the state of Israel millions of dollars every year, a state which, when the crimes were\ncommitted, did not even exist. The United States, Canada and Australia have all paid token\nreparations to the indigenous inhabitants of their territories who were murdered and\nexpropriated during and after colonization. The United Nations has already passed a\nresolution that Iraq must pay reparations for invading and destroying Kuwait. And the United\no\nStates has begun to pay compensation to its citizens of Japanese origin who were illegally and\nunjustly detained in concentration camps during the Second World War. Why, may I ask,\nis our case different, difficult or any more sensitive?\ndavan\n6\nWe do not expect the world to immediately come around to our position. We do not think\nthat victory will be ours tomorrow, or even the day after. It is said that the journey of a\nthousand years begins with but one step. We will today take what I believe is the important\nand first step. Our journey is long and our task is difficult, but we are confident that the\noutcome of this conference will determine what the next step must be. We must keep the\nmomentum going. We cannot allow a complacent, self-satisfied and self-indulgent world to\nso easily forget who bore the burden of its own development.\nad of\nigilab viteng me 1\nIsubivibni barnsonco\n-\nLet me end this brief welcome address by quoting one of the most illustrious African-\nis brief welco\nAmericans who ever lived.

First and foremost, I welcome you all to\nNigeria and to this very important Conference.\n2. Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, the convening of this Conference is indeed\nepoch making. While individuals and groups have talked over the years about the need for\nreparations to the black race for the historical wrongs done to the race, no one has attempted\nin a concrete way to translate this desire into reality which I believe is the basic objective of\nthis Conference.\n3.\nLet me therefore congratulate the Concord Press of Nigeria and especially its\nPublisher, Bashorun M. K. O. Abiola for this bold initiative. One major issue that will\nconfront this Conference is the articulating, in a very clear way, the need for reparations and\nhow much reparations. I believe this is crucial for the simple reason that human loss, human\nsuffering, human degradation, and disorientation cannot really be quantified in terms of\nmoney.\n4. For about four hundred and fifty years, Africans were caught, manacled and shipped\nacross the Atlantic to create wealth for their captors in the sugar cane, tobacco, and cotton\nplantations in the Americas. Great were the privation to which they were subjected. Those\nwho did not die during the raid or during the middle passage and were finally landed in the\nAmericas were sentenced to lives of servitude without any chance of manumission. The\npeople so forcibly transported have been estimated to number anything from 10 million to\n30 million. Those who were captured were the young and virile Africans, the very class on\nwhom the development of the continent would have devolved.\n5.\nThe chaos accompanying the slave trade retarded the African march towards\ndevelopment, progress and the advancement in science and technology. In fact, the period\nof the slave trade was the period of retrogression. While Africa and Europe were almost at\npar in terms of development up to the fifteenth century when great empires such as those of\nGhana, Mali, Songhai, Kanem-Borno, Benin, Ife, Oyo and Great Zimbabwe flourished, the\nslave trade destroyed all that was left of the African achievement and civilization of which\nancient Egypt, Meroe and Axum were historic manifestations. The chaos attendant on\nEuropean onslaught on Africa softened African resistance to imperialism and the eventual\nEuropean partition and the colonial administration finally concluded the African experience\nof subjugation. This colonial imposition did not go unchallenged.\n6. lein African resistance leaders such as Samori Toure of the Mandinkas, Sultan Attahiru\nI of the Sokoto Caliphate, Jaja of Opobo, Chaka the Zulu, Lobengula of the Ndebeles and\nthe great Menelik of Ethiopia fought gallant battles against superior arms with the exception\nof Menelik's Ethiopia, most of the African states succumbed to imperialism. But this was\nafter the loss of millions of African lives.\n7.\nDistinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, do I need to remind you of the millions of\nAfricans who lost their lives resisting the seizure of their countries? To the colonial powers,\nAfrican lives were expendable. In fact the doctrine prevailing then was massive infliction of\ninjury and casualties on their helpless victims because it was erroneously conjectured that\nAfricans did not value their lives. This strange doctrine led almost to the disappearance, of\nthe Hereros in the former German South-West Africa (now Namibia), while Angola was\nreduced to wilderness by the Portuguese as a result of four centuries of slave raiding and\ncolonial exploitation.\n8. The struggle for independence in many parts of Africa, particularly in such places as\nthe Cameroons, Algeria, Ethiopia and the entire Southern-African region was characterized\nby extreme violence with consequent loss of lives of millions of Africans. The recent\nviolence visited on Africans in the Front Line States in Southern Africa is too recent to need\nreiteration here. But for the avoidance of doubt, a recent Commonwealth report on Apartheid\nTerrorism puts the war-related death toll in Southern Africa at 1.5 million and the cost of\nSouth Africa's distabilization of the Front Line States since 1980 at a staggering $45 billion.\n14\n15",
            "9.\nThe upshot of all this is that never in the course of human history has a people\nsuffered so much for such a long time in the hands of fellow human beings for no other\ncause than avarice and material aggrandizement.\n10.\nPresident Léopold Sédar Senghor, that great African Statesman and poet once said\nAfricans, Jews, and Arabs constitute a trilogy of suffering peoples. But the fact is that of all\nthese three groups, the suffering of Africans has never really been seriously addressed.\n11. Even the granting of independence to African States is nothing more than a tactical\npolitical concession, while the economic exploitation and externally triggered civil wars\ncontinue. Since 1945, the world has witnessed attempts to redress the grievances of at least\nthe Jews if not those of Arabs. But in spite of our support for the Allies during the Second\nWorld War and despite the Atlantic Charter of Freedom, we Africans, both at home and in\ndiaspora, had again to fight against great odds to secure the rights which had been solemnly\npromised to everybody. That was not all. When the Marshall Plan for the Economic\nregeneration of Europe was put in place, we who had been victims of European colonialism\nexpected in vain a plan that would lead to the joint development of Africa as was the case\nof Europe. The point is that from the fifteenth century up till now we have remained\nmarginalized by the western world to which we have unfortunately been shackled by the\naccident of history and by our geographical proximity. Try as we can, Africa and Africans\nare not given the same opportunities as other regions and races to actualize themselves.\n12.\nDistinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, our kith and kin in the black diaspora have not\nfared better. The African-Americans in both South and North America have largely been kept\nat the periphery of social and economic happening in the New World. Economic and\ntherefore political power have by and large eluded our people. Those of us in the home\ncontinent have had our energy sapped by the struggle against racism and the battle for\ndecolonization.\n70\n26\nThis struggle for political freedom is almost over except in South Africa itself where there\nis institutionalized racism, with a system that is as unjust as it is inhuman. We need, in spite\nof the glimmer at the end of apartheid tunnel to redouble our effort at ending apartheid and\nto insist that the international community must not do away with the limited arms embargo\nand economic sanctions until the process of change becomes irreversible and permanent.\n13.\nDistinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, our political burden has been replaced by the\neconomic yoke of a crippling debt which continues to increase by compound interest no\nmatter our effort at amortization. We have come to a situation where development has\ngenerally grounded to a halt and a situation where most African countries exist and live for\ndebt repayment. In spite of our grinding poverty, our continent has witnessed massive capital\ntransfer to the rich nations of the north in the past decade while our people are being reduced\nto economic serfs in their own countries.\n14.\nW\nFor how long will our people stand for this without bringing down this evil edifice\nof an unjust economic system imposed on the whole world to benefit a fraction of mankind?\n15.\nWe Africans, whether at home or in diaspora have suffered too much largely because\nwe were divided through the force and brutality of former slave drivers and owners. A\nyawning chasm separated Africans at home from our kit and kin abroad in the past. Out of\nignorance and misinformation, our brothers in diaspora looked at those at home as uncouth\nand uncivilized natives whose ancestors were responsible for their plight in the new world.\nThe Africans at home in reaction felt they were the authentic inheritors of all that was\nglorious and edifying in the Africans past. Our common enemies exploited this division.\nxilidom\n16. The political struggle has largely been fought and won, what we need now is\nfreedom. We demand that Africa should be granted economic freedom through debt forgiving\nand total debt write-offs. We demand African Marshall Plan to compensate for the century\nof abuse and neglect. We demand full equality with all men for African at home and in\ndiaspora. We call on all the countries in Europe and the Americas to compensate Africa for\nthe untold hardship and exploitation that the continent had ben subjected to in the past.\n17. We make these demands because services of our forefathers in the American\nplantations were unrewarded and unpaid for. We make these demands because the\nexploitation of Africa during the period of colonial rule further impoverished us and\nenhanced the development of the West. We make these demands because this is in the\ninterest of mankind. Remember when that humanity suffers a little, somewhere, all humanity\nsuffers a little. The world cannot continue like this with the vast majority under pain while\na few luxuriate in affluence.\n18.\nThe time to make a fresh start is now and Europe and the Americas must redress the\nimbalance in their relation with Africa and Africans. It is time for descendants of the\noppressors and the oppressed to open a new chapter based on mutually rewarding and\nbeneficial relationship.\n19. Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, we must not give up the struggle for total\nemancipation of the black race from poverty, want, social degradation, economic\n16\n17",
            "saying that unity is strength. We Africans, both at home and in diaspora must pull our\nresources together in order to advance the cause of our race. Numerically, the African races\nis fewer than the other races on this global village, and it is a duty for us all to share the\nbounties of this planet without endangering the survival of each and every one of us. The only\nway to move forward is to support ourselves in whatever we do. For example, we must\norganized ourselves in the Americas so that we can constitute a pressure group that will\nensure that policies emanating from the new world are favourable to the advancement of our\npeople. We can borrow a leaf from the Jewish lobby in America which ensures that the State\nof Israel gets budgetary support running into billions of dollars every year from the United\nStates.\n20.\nI am aware of the activities of Trans Africa and the Congressional Black Caucus, but\nwe need to do more than these two bodies are doing to bring the plight and need of Africa\ninto great focus.\n21.\nThere is also a need for investment to come into Africa through mobilization of black\nfunds and enterprise particularly in the United States and the Caribbean. It should not be too\ndifficult for Africans and their brethren in diaspora to form joint ventures to stimulate and\ndevelop the economy of our common homeland. We Africans at home should also follow a\npolicy of complementarity whereby we invest in black enterprises in the United States and\nBrazil and the Caribbean, for example. There is no reason on earth why Black banks in the\nUnited States and Black entrepreneurs should not attract business from our thriving oil sector.\n22. It should also be possible for Africans in the new world to enjoy dual citizenship of\nwhatever African country they decide to adopt as their home country.\n23.\nanhub\nTo\nOne of the greatest huddles that Africa must overcome is the lack of technological\nknow-how. There is a pool of this kind of people in the Black diaspora waiting to be tapped.\nIt only requires the approximate mechanism and information to be put in place so as to\nexplore and exploit this possibilities.\n24.\nWe need to fully integrate the African economy. The present division of the continent\ninto puny states cannot but act as a drag to the wheel of progress. We must overcome the\nfissiparous tendencies that seem to undermine Africa's inexorable march towards greater\nunity.\nWe must unite or perish for Africa and Africans are both an endangered continent and specie.\nThat is the truth. The world is not for the week but the strong. If we want to survive as a\n18\npeople we must unite and be strong.\n25.\nIt is true that the international environment for centuries has not been favourable_to\nthe blackman. Having diagnosed our problems we must adopt the appropriate solution and\ntake the bull by the horn. It will not be easy but we must begin. And now.\n26.\nWhile demanding reparation, it must be clear to us that we are not building a world\nof racial exclusivity. This will be negative and unhealthy. We Africans are not seeking to\ndominate anybody. Nor are we going to allow anybody or group dominate us. What we seek\nis partnership with other people. But this partnership must be built on mutual respect.\n27. The rest of the world cannot only help but must help so that together we can jointly\nbuild a world where no one is oppressed and a world of one human race built on harmony\nof black, brown, yellow and white races moving in unison to develop together a natural\nendowment and bounties of nature while preserving our environment. This is the only way\nif the world is to develop peacefully.\n28.\n201\nThe present situation where an important segment of the human family feels\nmarginalized and victim of a conjuncture of man made evil forces is not a good augury for\nthe peace of the world.\n29.\nIn the true spirit of interdependence, all nations, big or small, rich or poor, black or\nwhite at varying levels of development, have important and specific roles to play if the\nobjective of a prosperous and vibrant global village is to be placed within reach. All it takes\nis the political will to attain this objective and I believe that there is sufficient political\nrealism to reinforce the momentum and justness of our cause. We should summon and take\nthat political decision to realize the desired goal of full equality of human family. We can do\nit now and now is the time.\n30.

N.\nOKOH, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS &\nSTATISTICS, UNIVERSITY OF BENIN, BENIN CITY, NIGERIA\nbis\nI.\nINTRODUCTION\nbodyna\nmob\nThe economies of the developing countries have been the most hard hit by the on-\ngoing debt crisis. The economic growth of these developing world, especially, that of the\ndeveloping countries of Africa has been uneven. Those countries are struggling to get their\neconomies on the growth path but the economic policies which have been prescribed to bring\nabout the quick cure appear not to be working fast enough. Africa being the largest continent\nmwobna\nwith the least developed categories of nations appears to be the most threatened.\nExperts have, at various international academic fora, been advocating for structural\nadjustment policies and debt relief policies involving debt rescheduling, interest rate\ncapitalization and reduction, debt forgiveness, debt default and outright debt repudiation.\nSome of the structural adjustment policies have been implemented in some of the African\ncountries with all the attendant sacrifices that go with it without any visible measure of\nsuccess. However, it could be said without contradiction that one of the reasons the measures\ntaken failed to provide the quick relief expected was the failure of the developed countries\nto provide the capital inflow associated with the envisaged economic policies.\n1st bar\nInsiontua\nBan avibaido\nThe failure of the industrialized countries to help provide effective debt relief to the\nAfrican countries has galvanized African-American intellectuals and their African brothers\nto demand for what is called reparation to the African countries.\nba\nReparation may be defined as a proposed repayment or compensation to the African\ncountries for the past injustice meted to them by the colonial masters. The payment\ncompensates for the expropriation of human, material and natural resources of the African\ncountries. The black slave provided slave labour to develop European and American\neconomies. These slaves were forcefully removed from their African families to Europe and\nAmerica with severe tortures and deprivations. While, many of them died on their way,\nothers survived to tell the ugly story of slavery. It is also on record that the mercantilist\neconomic philosophy advocated and practiced naked economic exploitation of the African\ncolonies for the benefit of the \"mother country\". Now there is the advocacy that this\neconomic rape of African economies be assessed and payment made by the perpetrators of\nthis crime.\nayo\nThis paper examines the African debt crisis and the possibility of using reparations\nas a strategy of foreign exchange inflow from the former colonial masters. The paper is\ndivided into four sections:\nII\nSection I is the introduction.\nno noqmi bas\nSection II examines the nature of the African economy, while or more upst\nSection III takes an in depth analysis of the African debt crisis and problems of\nreparation. Finally,\nSection IV concludes the paper.\nTHE AFRICAN ECONOMY\nThe economies of African countries have been described as the \"most vulnerable and\nleast developed\" in the world. The reason is that the continent accounts for two-thirds of the\nUnited Nations designated \"least developed countries\" (LDCs).\nThe major problem of the African economy is the nature of its structure. Ake (1981,\nAdedeji (1981), and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, ECA (1989) have\nall identified the basic structural problems of the African economy. They see the basic\nproblems to be concerned with the pattern of production, consumption, and exchange. These\nconstitute the most fundamental causes of African underdevelopment and retrogression. ECA\nsummarized the bottlenecks as:\ni.\n100\nii.\nThe\niii.\nThe predominance of subsistence and commercial activities;\nnarrow, disarticulate production base with ill-adapted technology;\nThe neglected informal sectors;\norla (009\nตอ\ndiwỡng\niv.\nThe degraded environment;\nV.\nnivloz\nSpreds\ninsta\nvii.\nLopsided development due to urban bias of public policies generally and development\ntum Tavo od taum yrit\npolicies in particular;\nvi. The fragmentation of the African economy;\n15m 20\namaldorg\nThe openness and excessive dependance of the economies including dependence on\nexternal factor inputs; and\nviii. Weak institutional capabilities.\n12\n出版\nbut suffice it to say that these are the factoral\nhajdeb nom od\nGiven the space and time constraint, it is not possible to dwell on each of the above\nhave made Africa underdeveloped. As a\nproducer of primary commodities, the African lives at the mercy and subject to the\n20\n20\n21",
            "manipulation of the developed world. The prices of cocoa, coffee, cotton, etc, continue to\nfluctuate in the international market and they have fallen victims of manipulation. Even the\nprice of crude oil is manipulated by the West despite the existence of OPEC. The most\ndecisive among these factors according to Adedeji, is the economic dependence of African\ncountries and their excessive external orientation. The African economies continues to depend\non the former colonial masters both in terms of economic policies, and consumption, export\nand import orientation. This dependence has made the African economy susceptible to\nfrequent external shocks.\n10\nng bhe lens\nmo\nlens, dinst\nThese countries cannot generate enough foreign exchange to pursue meaningful\ndevelopment programmes. In fact, in some of the African countries, economic development\nhas become unattainable because people who are unable to afford the basic needs, cannot be\ntalking of capital investment that will bring about economic growth and development. The\nmost immediate pre-occupation is how to get their three square meals a day. Some have\nturned to beggar nations, begging for food, aid and the lack of such aid has reduced the\ninhabitants of these countries to mere shadow of their former selves.\nThere exists extreme poverty which causes excessive malnutrition in mo't of the\nAfrican countries and some of them are yet to be touched by modernization. Africa is\nseriously plagued by hunger, draught, rising population, etc. The food production is not\nkeeping pace with population growth. In fact, there is no dismal description that could give\na vivid picture or reflection of what exists in some of the African countries.\nAfrican socio-economic indicators (Table I) is nothing to write home. For example\nGuillaumont (1990) shows that the manufacturing sector contributes a meager 12 per cent to\nthe GDP; The GDP per capita is about $544.00 in 1987, while average per capita GDP\ngrowth rate between 1980-1988 was -1.9%. The average life expectancy is 52 and debt\nyears\nas a percentage of GDP in 1988 was 94.1 per cent. Comparing the statistics with that of\nindustrialized countries, one could not but sympathize with the African countries, but the Age,\nof mere sympathy must be over. There must be a practical positive approach to solving\nAfrican problems. The African governments on their part with short-fall in foreign exchange\nrevenue, have resorted to massive borrowing as the solution to the African predicament.\nIII\nAFRICAN DEBT CRISIS AND REPARATION\nThe African debt crisis became more visible in the 1980s. The Sub-Saharan African\ndebt which was $57.5 billion in 1980 according to IMF 1989 Report rose to $137.8 billion\nin 1987 an increase of 140 per cent between 1980 and 1987, while an estimated African debt\nas at 1987 stood at 220 billion. This is shown in Table II. The debt burden whether measured\nGiven the extent of African debt and its burden, various solutions have been suggested\nfor debt relief or reduction policies. Most of these policies hinge on structural adjustment\npolicies, debt rescheduling policies, interest rate capitalization etc, and in many countries\npolicies have been geared toward the achievement of these goals. However, in spite of\ncorrective economic policy measures that have been put in place, the African economies are\nyet to visible improvement. Okoh (1990) concluded that any economic policy of debt relief\nshort of debt write-off or debt forgiveness is not very helpful.\nto\nHowever some African/American scholars have recently re-opened the issue of\nreparation. Reparation as earlier defined is payment of compensation to African countries or\nthe black race that suffered slavery in the hands of Western European countries and the\nUnited States of America. The advocates believe strongly that these countries used slave\nlabour to develop their economies and today are pursuing economic policy measures that\ndquors for\ncontinue to make Africa overly dependent and underdeveloped. They believe that the\ndepravation suffered by these African countries was responsible for their state of\nunderdevelopment. To ensure justice and fair play the developed world needs to pay African\ncountries a lump sum of money for not only \"taking their resources\" but also for the inhuman\ntreatment of the slaves; and to show remorse.\naved idal\nnoillid 22\nis\nWhile this paper sees this advocacy as a noble cause, the chance of its succeeding is\nremote. In fact, it may even be seen as one of those trivial calls of a radical few and therefore\ntreated with contempt. Many do not see it as a serious demand.\nloq A.noitulo\nemaldona\nThe first problem with this demand is how the compensation should be determined?\nPayment of reparation is an admission of guilt which may lead to many more unknown\ndemands and legal action. How does one determine what is due to each African country or\nthe black race? How are we sure that the payment would be not polarize African or the black\nrace even more? To this author there is no amount that would be sufficient as compensation\nexcept the entire assets of the European and American countries.\nSnob sam\n10\nThis paper will like to suggest that instead of the black race advocating for reparations,\nan impossible task, African countries should be using reparations as a strategy for debt write-\noff and increased capita; inflows through grant-in-aid. There is need for African countries to\nask for improved aid flows, debt relief, and greater access to the developed country's markets\nfor their few limited exports, if Africa is to accelerate the rate of economic growth and\ndevelopment. Pearson (1970) in an outlined strategy to encourage economic development of\nthe developing countries observed that trade policies of advanced countries raised many\nobstacles to the growth of export earnings of less developed economies. He therefore\n22\n23",
            "of economic growth and development. Pearson (1970) in an outlined strategy to encourage\neconomic development of the developing countries observed that trade policies of advanced\ncountries raised many obstacles to the growth of export earnings of less developed\neconomies. He therefore recommended a framework that would allow for a free and equitable\ninternational trade. In fact, the future looks bleak with 41 African countries classified as least\ndeveloped countries in 1990. This is an increase of 16 countries since 1980. A country is so\nclassified if its GDP, adult literacy rate, the contribution of manufacturing value added to the\nGDP etc, are below what is expected as normal contribution. The ratio of debt to GDP of\nthese countries has risen in the 1980s according to African Recovery from 53 per cent in\n1984 to 78.2 per cent in 1987.\nThe industrialized countries appear to have been showing sympathy, which of course\nis not enough to ameliorate the debt burden of the African countries. For example, these\nindustrialized countries are implementing some debt relief policy measures for-African LDCs\nwhich include debt cancellation, especially for the poorest countries, and the total of the\namount so far cancelled was $3 billion in 1988. However, in June 1989, France, Japan, and\nthe U.S. decided to cancel the official debt of the poorest African countries. So far, about\n$5 billion African debt have been cancelled by the U. S., the Federal Republic of Germany\nand Belgium.\nTo sonado\nThis type of selective debt policy while commendable clearly falls short of an\neffective solution. A policy of debt write-off and increased inflows of aids is the only answer\nto solving African economic problems.\nwowplay a\nIV. CONCLUSION\nof besl\nwod ai bamb\nThis paper has argued that what Africa needs is debt write-off and increased inflows\nof capital from the industrialized world. It takes the position that reparations pose a problem\nof admission of guilt which may have legal implications. How does one estimate the amount\nof compensation to be paid to the African countries for looting its resources or for the\npsychological damage done to the black race through slavery? Again assuming the Western\ncountries agree to pay for expropriating black man's resources and the slave labour, what\noda\nwould be the magic formula for sharing of the amount paid among the African countries, or\nthe black race in general?\nbis dont\nས\nsilan dab awo\nbevormi not as\nIn view of the above obvious problems, the author believes that the present rhetoric\non reparations should be a mere strategy to forcing the industrialized world to action because\nthey contributed to the underdevelopment of African countries. They should therefore\ncontribute towards its effective development. The paper therefore calls for debt write-off and\nincreased inflows of aid.\nLele and Nabi (1960) observed that one of the fundamental problems of the\ndeveloping countries is that most of the public loans were invested in wasteful non-income\nproducing industries. Okoh (1990) observed that public grants and loans have in most cases\nbeen squandered on meaningless projects. African countries must uphold the virtues of\ndiscipline and probity. African economic policy measures must be inward looking, instead\nof encouraging more dependency. Africa must be aware that it is fast becoming less and less\nrelevant to the growth of the western world. The continent has to think very seriously how\nto avoid being completely marginalized. This is an uphill task in view of Europe 1992 and\nthe events in the Eastern Europe.\nDeer guvoh mot borgsbA 2\n135\n24\n25\n25",

            "NOTES BY RICHARD FRANKLIN\nAMERICA\nIt is one thing to feel exploited. But it is important to develop a quantified estimate of the\nmagnitude of the exploitation. Measurements matter. The discussion of remedies will not be\nconstructive until serious measurements are produced. So a research program needs to be established.\nThat will allow other to refute, dispute, and argue over every technical detail. And that is healthy.\nLet that technical debate run its course. In the end out of that process will come a sounder basis for\ndiscussion.\nHonourable,\nLadies and Gentlemen\nAnell Imine\nThank you for the invitation to join you in considering this question of the current policy\nInomuallinb\nimplications of historical economic relations among nations.\nI have long believed that policy analysts have overlooked an important issue, and the debate\non development has, therefore, been incomplete and distorted. Now There are indications that this\noversight is being corrected. What are the practical consequences of past economic injustice? How\ncan they be accounted for? This conference can contribute to important clarifications, and that can\nbenefit all parties in the long run.\nI am interested in looking at the problem of what we are calling \"reparations\" or \"restitution\"\nas a technical issue. It is a problem in national income accounts, and in international balance of\npayments accounting.\nAll the parties have until now made policy based on an incomplete understanding of the full\ncosts and benefits of historic trade, investment, labor and other relations. But now there can be\nsufficient technical grasp of the problem to permit economist to estimate the benefits to those who\nbenefit today from past coerced, unequal exchange transactions.\nUse betinU\nWe have better statistics, as well as better theory. And, we have computers. Before we\nenjoyed these fairly recent technical advances, it was not possible to get very far in measuring such\nfactors as the costs and benefits, even though there have been analysts who intuitively argued that\nthere had been systematic unjust enrichments resulting from past wrongful economic arrangements\nbetween Africa and major trade and investment partners.\nNow analysis can replace intuition. And accounts can be developed and refined. They can\nbe produced for long historical periods. And they can also be produced annually from now on.\nDiscussion of reparations, therefore, ought to be as unemotional as possible. It is obviously\nan emotion laden subject. But if it is to have practical positive and constructive consequences, then\na rigorous research base is essential.\nLet me say, again, that I am interested in justice here, not merely the perceived self interest\nof any party. I believe that the world has many examples of relations that might be remedied by\nrestitution. Indeed, most chronic conflicts within and among nations, seem based, at least, in part, on\ngrievances that boil down to the feeling that there have been massive unjust enrichments at the\nexpense of one party's ancestors. And that current distributions of income and wealth are therefore\nillegitimate and indefensible.\nbos\nliud\nI see that in East, West, North and South. Someday, I expect that the U. N., or World\nBank/IMF, or some such body will take on the job of monitoring worldwide economic transactions\nfrom this perspective. They will look for deviations from some agreed to standards of just dealings.\nAnd then they will quantify the deviation. And that information will help correct the problems. It will\nshed light. And the very act of illuminating these matters will help bring an end to exploitation, and\nunequal relations. And it will also help the parties bargain over remedies for past injustices.\nWhen people come to know with some precision, who is benefiting from unjust enrichments,\nhow they are benefiting, and how much they benefit, it will energize them to put a stop to it. So it's\ncrucial to know not just that there is exploitation, but how much there is.\nitzyb to zmolding\nI think a stable, just, well informed world will be a better place for all. It will be more\nefficient and it will be more equitable. There will be retributive remedies for past injustices. And the\ncurrent holders of unjust enrichments will consider that undesirable. But even then, if they look again,\nwill see that in a larger sense, they will be better off in a stable world with fewer inarticulated\ngrievances leading to seemingly irrational political behaviour.\nI hope you will decide to set up a technical analytical center. It should undertake the kind of\nongoing, rigorous, impartially reviewed analysis that I have described. It should cooperate with\nscholars and policy analysts worldwide.\n30\n31",

And it can,\nthen, offer a basis for remedies on a scale that can truly accelerate development. Jumping ahead a\nn the for\nbit, let me briefly comment on the form that eventual reparations might take. And then, finally, I\nwould at some risk comment on the matter of internal discipline and sound management.\n2001\nReparations, and I hope a less emotionally charged, neutral name can be found, should be\napplied in investment forms.

The original\nen short hos almiw\nexploitation didn't deprive of subsistence. They managed to subsist. What it did was divert the\ncapital that they would have used to strengthen themselves and their communities. Therefore, what\nreparations should do is restore that capital in a way that accelerate sustainable development and\nbuilt strength. It should be used to accelerate the development of crucial institution, and to develop\na broad class of skilled, knowledgeable, disciplined workers, technicians, managers, scientists and\nprofessionals. And it should be used to develop the small and middle size businesses that can be the\nbackbone of broad economic growth and diversification.\nI think those prescriptions make sense universally, north, south, east and west. I hope as a\nguest, I am not being presumptuous, or out of line, to simply underline the importance of broad\nimprovements in behaviour for any people seeking to accelerate their development.\nIf leaders anywhere, can find the means to inspire everyone to improve their basic life styles,\nthen that group is likely to find greater success, whatever it's objectives.\nThese internal improvements, together with enhanced resources from all sources, including\nfrom reparations can produce economic success. But without the basic commitment to order,\ndemocracy, justice, equity, efficiency, humanity at all levels of any society, additional capital is\nlikely to be used sub-optimally.\nTo summarize, a group of senior economists and policy analysts should be established in\nexisting or new research centers to examine these issues.\nbad\nLA\nbox\nFinally a word on development.

            "SE REPARATIONS TO THE BLACK WORLD - AND HOW NOT TO GET THEM of\nby Chinweizu\n(lali ai quang Jad) nadi\nPaper for presentation to the World Conference on Reparations to Africa and Africans in the\nDiaspora, at the NIIA, Lagos, December 13 & 14, 1990. imonos soubor ass\nyonal\ncomeb\nYllemitqo-due\nHISTORICAL BACKGROUND\nاللادان له\nIn the 16th century, Arabs and Europeans began the current phase of their assault on the\nBlack World. In Africa before that time, the no man's land between the Black World and its Euro-\nAsiatic invaders had stabilized north of the Tropic of Cancer, north of a line running through\nTegheza in the West and Aswan in the East. But in that calamitous century, Europeans and Arabs\nrenewed the age-old Euro-Asiatic offensive through which, in the preceding 2000 years, they had\nseized Africans lands north of the Tropic of Cancer.\nThe 16th century was the century when the Portuguese vanguard of the European invaders\ndistabilized the Bukongo Kingdom, and obliged it to supply them with slaves. That was when the\nPortuguese subjugated Kilwa, Sofala, Pate, Mombasa and other coastal towns in East Africa, and\nseized control of their Indian Ocean trade. That was when the Portuguese sent an expedition inland\nagainst Mwanamupata to seize its gold.\nThat was when Moroccan Arabs seized Tegheza and its salt mines, and sent across the Sahara\nan expedition which conquered and destroyed Songhay. That was when the Arabs of Egypt when\non their expansionist offensive against Nubia and Ethiopia, and conquered the Kingdom of Alwa.\nThat was when Bedoin Arabs infiltrated the region around Lake Chad and settled there.\nThese expeditions are a watershed in the modern history of the Black World. They\ninaugurated some three and a half centuries of a slaving holocaust which destroyed Black African\nsocieties and condemned hundreds of millions of Blacks to death and enslavement at the hand of\nEuropeans and Arabs. And that slaving holocaust, by far the greatest holocaust in human history,\nwas followed by the European conquest, colonization and neo-colonization of the Black World.\nThat general offensive against the Black World, which began five centuries ago, has not\nstopped. It is still going on in South Africa, in the Sudan, in Mauritania and other places.\nWhat we are to assess are the damage we have sustained, and the losses we have incurred\nin the course of five centuries of an unprovoked invasion of the Black homeland, with its resulting\ndispersal of Black Africans; as well as what reparations we should exact, and how.\nPRECEDENTS FOR REPARATIONS\nReparations for grievous and gratuitous harm done to nations and peoples are not new. In\nthis century alone, there have been some important precedents.\nbotonin If Germany is paying reparations (amount undisclosed, but allegedly huge) to Israel for the\nJewish victims of Hitler's 12 years long holocaust, why should the European World not pay\nreparations to the Black World for some 350 years of slaving holocaust?\nIf Germany paid indemnities to the Entente Powers for its responsibility in causing WW1,\nwhy should the European World not pay reparations to the Black World for five centuries of\nunprovoked wars, conquest and looting?\nIf Saddam Hussein is expected to pay reparations to Kuwait for gratuitously invading and\ndestroying it, why should the Arab world not pay reparations to the Black World for gratuitous acts\nof invasion, destruction and enslavement (both physical and cultural;) in the Black World?\nIf the Japanese have apologized to the Koreans for their atrocious behaviour during their\nconquest and occupation of Korea; and if the North Koreans are demanding $5 bn from Japan in\nreparations for 35 years of occupation, why should the Black World not exact apologies and\nreparations from both the Europeans and Arab Worlds for five centuries of Atrocities?\n23\n2010 smoz To\nPARTICULARS OF CLAIMS\nblow The following are some of the main items for which reparations may be sought. Our\nhistorians and economists have to calculate the specific amount to be paid after determining the\nquantities involved, and their market prices at the time each item was expropriated or destroyed.\nA) Rent on lands expropriated by European and Arab settlers during the last 500 years (e.g.\nbanoge some 500 years in the Sudan and Chad; some 400 years in South Africa, Mauritania and\nMali; some 100 years in Kenya, Zimbabwe and Namibia.)\n34\n35",
            "B)\nCompensation for material and social destruction during the Slaving Holocaust: houses,\nvillages, cities, mines, farms, markets, etc., which vanished in the course of procuring slaves\nfor Arabs and Europeans.\nC) Indemnities for all wars and all campaigns of pacification waged by Europeans and Arabs\nanblue on Black peoples and nations. to noissyni\nTo se\nD)\nE)\nF)\nγια\neze\nH)\nCompensation for resources expropriated (animal, vegetable and mineral): i. e. cattle, sheep,\ngoats, etc.; cotton, rubber, palm produce, etc.; gold, tin, copper, iron, petroleum, etc.\nBack pay for work done, both unpaid and underpaid, both as slave labour in the Diaspora\nand forced labour in Africa. of\nzuoliutera brs auovsing tot anoi\nCompensation for lives lost... the hundreds of millions of blacks who died through slaving,\nconquest, colonization, pacification and the wars of decolonization. For instance, the\nhundreds of thousands of Herero of Namibia who the German Imperial army exterminated\nin what proved to be a dressed rehearsal for the Nazi extermination of six million Jews; the\n10 million Congolese who were killed by the agents of Belgium's King Leopold II, while\nbeing forced to collect rubber; all the blacks killed in the wars of independence fought by\nthe Mau-Mau, the PAIGC, FRELIMO, etc.\nmobni bisq\nbisq ynism\nG) 25 Compensation for distabilization and eradication of Black Cultures through forced\nEuropeanization and Arabization.\nIgnitool bas tasupnoo answ badloverqu\nPunitive damages for the slander and defamation of the Black race, slander which led to our\nbns gnbeing despised, and which contributed to our loss of self-confidence. The central theme of\nthis slander has been the claim that the Black Race -- the very one which initiated civilization\nin the world -- is primitive and has contributed nothing to the world.\nOpportunity cost for what we would have made of the people and resources of which we\nwere forcibly deprived.\nano ads of besigologs over ons\nI\nInterest on the total compensation for the above items. to noisquooo bus supo\nol\nbos sigologs 15 ton bowl or bloodz\nESTIMATE OF REPARATIONS\nI)\nJ)\nabhow de A bas na\nd mont\nNorth Korea's demand for $5 bn for a current population of some 20m, for 35 years of\noccupation and exploitation should give us an idea of the Black World could demand for 500 years\nfor some 500m people. The comparable amount could be approximately $2000 bn. But that would\nbe just the principal -- what we should have been paid in the cause of the 500 years, but were not.\nbovlovni\nOn average, that principal has been old for 250 years. At 5 per cent compound interest, each\n$1m of that principal would now be worth $198.3 bn, or approximately $200 bn. Which is roughly\nwhat sub-Sahara Africa allegedly owes to aid givers and international banks. At 5 per cent compound\ninterest, the principal of $2000 bn would by now be worth $1/2 bnbn! Compared to that total, the\nworld current debt is insignificant -- a mere 0.00004 per cent, or 40 micro per cent, or 40 millionths\nof one per cent of the reparations which are due us.\nThese calculations of compensation have been based on the North Korean claims. Considering\nthe far greater scope and intensity of the damage inflicted on the Black World, the principal of the\ndebt to the Black World would be considerably greater. By the time our scholars quantify the items\nof our claims, we might find that even $100,000 bn is a conservative estimate of the principal. If\nso, principal and interest would total $25 bnbn or more. In any case, the reparations which are due\nto the Black World are in the $bnbn order of magnitude.\nWHAT TO DO WITH THE REPARATIONS\nWhen we secure the reparations, what might we use the funds for? I would suggest that we\npay off any genuine debt owed by the Black World to international banks and aid agencies; and use\nthe rest to create a Black World Bank for Reconstruction and Development.\ngnol avad\nHOW NOT TO GET REPARATIONS\nabm/Late last year, I wrote a \"Letter to Europe\" in the maiden issue of Liber, a European Review\nof Books which appears in five European languages. In that piece, \"Imperialism and its inheritance\",\nI drew attention to a debt \"which is owed Africa by Europe for five centuries of slave and forced\nlabour, for vast lands with forest and mineral wealth, all of which were commandeered for the\ndevelopment of Europe.\" I then recommended a project \"to secure from Europe reparations for this,\nreparations which will be used to financed the reconstruction and development of Africa.\" I was\nsurprised and saddened when a friend of mine, an African, equated this demand for reparations with\nbegging for foreign aid. loght\nOM szil\nmot\nSanoitelugog sletenings noileniumsize bas nolaugas Jesup to\nLest some others in the Black World should misconstrue this conference's demand for\nreparations as begging for aid, let me emphasize that reparation is not aid: it is compensation exacted\nfor past injuries. Aid is for pitied beggars; reparation is for those strong enough to exact it. Nobody\npays reparations to a crippled beggar; when you tire of his importuning, you kick him out of your\nway. Only to those they respect or need do people pay reparations.\nbna no\nmaines\nabinal If we want reparations, we are obliged to create the conditions under which reparations can\nbe exacted. Until we are respected and feared; until European and Arab Worlds need our goodwill;\nuntil we bring enough moral and practical pressures to bear on them, we can expect no reparations.\nSuch is the lesson of the Jewish and the Korean experiences.\n10 au baimp 01 2\ndous time Anisos even of\noil lon ob\nba mad\nNow, what are the prospects that our demand today for reparations will be listened to, let\nalone met?

Many studies already exist detailing out what this\nimplies. The best known of such works is probably Walter Rodney's How Europe Under-developed\nAfrica. We can explore the implication of the massive loss of population which has been likened to\nprolonged hemorrhage in a person, leading to severe anaemia and the need for blood transfusion. We\ncan examine the consequent uneven exchange, economic exploitation and technological retardation;\nthe undermining of the very fabric of society and destruction of any sense of regional solidarity.\nRather than attempt to explore these in detail, I wish instead to examine aspects of the Slave\nTrade, Colonialism and Neocolonialism which justify their being linked together in considering the\nquestion of Reparation. Reparation, as we know, is linked up with the concept of crime in\nInternational Law. I therefore wish to examine the criminal factor in the Slave Trade, Colonialism\nand Neocolonialism.\nTHE SLAVE TRADE\nTA\nThe world was slow to recognize the fact that the Slave Trade was a crime against humanity.\nMany acts which individually were recognized as crimes in international law were regular features\nof the slave trade but connived at. For example, piracy and kidnapping were recognized as crime in\ninternational law but connived at in the slave trade, especially in the recruitment of slaves. Similarly,\nwhile attempts continued in Europe to bring war under some international regulation, slave wars\ncontinued to defy regulation. Slave wars were often undeclared wars, wars of aggression, total war,\nviolating the right of ransom etc.\nREW\nThe notorious Middle Passage illustrated the extent of the denial of human dignity. Even\ncriminals being transported to Australia were not subjected to such degradation. In the New world,\nthis denial of the humanity of black slaves was legalized and institutionalized.\nEventually, Britain took the lead in seeking international acceptance that it is a crime to divest\nhuman beings of their humanity and treat them as chattel property to be bought and sold. By that\ntime, the Atlantic Slave Trade had lasted four centuries. The loss to Africa taking into account those\n40\n41",
            "time, the Atlantic Slave Trade had lasted four centuries. The loss to Africa taking into account those\nwho died in the wars and in transit in Africa and on the Atlantic crossing, not to mention the Arab\nSlave Trade, was over 20 million.\nCOLONIALISM\nBritain turned against the slave trade, but not against other forms of slavery and crimes\nagainst humanity. Europeans eventually gave up the slave trade because the prospect of exploiting\nthe labour, land and other resources of Africa became increasingly more attractive than the slave\ntrade. In the transition from the slave trade to colonialism, the Europeans used African involvement\nin the slave trade as argument that they were not part of the civilized world, and as such were not\ncovered in international law. Thus the Congress of Berlin drew up plans for the partition of Africa\nwithout a single African power being represented. Partition was regulated under international law\nin so far as it concerned the relationship between different European States; the relationship between\nthem and African peoples was outside the law.\n52092 yns lo noil\nob ban ylalboa to side view odi to gainiunobu o\nThe wars of conquest, for the most part were crimes against humanity in their ruthlessness,\nand genocide. Atrocities in the Congo Free State are well documented; so also the case against the\nGermans in Namibia, Tanganyika and the Cameroon by the allied victors at the end of World War\nI. This does not mean that the record of the victors in the expropriation of land in British South\nAfrica, Rhodesia, Kenya, or by the Portuguese in Angola and Mozambique, and the forced labour\nand forced conscription for service in the trenches of Europe in winter, and the carrier corps in East\nAfrica, were any better than that of the Germans.\nNEOCOLONIALISM\nЗЛАЯТ ДУА12 ЯНТ\n12 ori indi og orexingobs of wola aaw bhow adT\n29 The League of Nations began the process of seeking to bring colonialism under international\nregulation and show up its aberrations as crimes against humanity. The territories taken from the\nGermans were placed under Mandates involving some degree of international supervision. Thus, for\nexample, Namibia passed from the German frying pan into South African fire. The hypocrisy\nnotwithstanding, the international community began to call colonialism into question because of its\ndenial of freedom, lack of opportunities, neglect of economic development and impoverishment\nthrough ruthless economic exploitation. Colonialism was exposed as a crime against humanity.\nylingib nemur lo fainab ads to justxa\nbhoy Europeans powers conceded political independence but have retained control over the\neconomies of Africa integrated into the World System in a position of dependence. The world has\nso far refused to recognize that neocolonialism, like the slave trade and colonialism before it, is a\ncrime against humanity; that the social, economic and tech. gap separating Africa from Europe has\nwidened immeasurably; that Africa is no longer able to feed itself or cope with any drought; some\ncountries collapsed or are on the verge of collapse. The international community has so far rejected\ncalls for a new international Economic order allowing for a more just system of international trade\nand more justice in the pricing of primary products relative to manufactured goods.\nBREAKING THE VICIOUS CIRCLE\nPerhaps eventually the world will recognize neocolonialism as a crime against humanity and\nseek other forms of exploitation to keep Africa dependent and underdeveloped, making it a perpetual\nsource of cheap labour, producer of whatever raw material Europe has need of, and surviving on\nFood Aid and Development Aid.\nammed pood\nThe call for Reparations is an attempt to break through the vicious circle. It is a search for\na more just international order, a redistribution of surplus funds now invested on armaments,\npollution of the environment and unnecessary wars and threats of wars. If the international\ncommunity can perceive that what Africa needs is not Structural Adjustment Programme that over\ndevalues our currency but fails to produce the expended level of investment, but Reparations to be\ninvested specifically on infrastructure particularly in education, the development of Africa will prove\nmore beneficial to the world than underdevelopment and dependence.\nTHE HOLOCAUST AND AFRICA\nThe demand for Reparations involves comparison between the fate of Africa and the\nHolocaust. Can anything in history be compared in scale and criminality to the crime of the\nHolocaust? Those directly hit by the Holocaust will insist that nothing can be so compared, but this\nis because we are allowing the world to forget the factor of crime against humanity and the\ninternational order involved in the Slave Trade, colonialism and Neocolonialism.\nLet me conclude by pointing out that the comparison is well founded. The Germans\nthemselves tried to involve Africa in the so-called Final Solution. Before deciding on the gas\nChambers, the original idea was to transport the jews into works camps in Madagascar, then under\nthe control of the puppet regime of France. When the tide of war turned and the Allies began to\nemerge victorious, before deciding to create Israel in Palestine, an earlier plan was to create it in\nCyrenaica in Eastern Libya. It is in the nature of colonialism that neither the Germans nor the\nvictorious Allies considered it necessary to consult Africans before including them in the search for\nthe final solution.\nlim srce no bien\nглоб\nyhalugoq el sadw nonsm of\non\nboh zussy berbud soul a novo zgold\nob to noillion adi o equiq & quouindo ylize\n42\n43",

The moral and other\nclaims by Pan-Africanists and others to the readjustment by Reparations has been hammered out\nslowly but clearly on the anvils of justice through the years. s\nSom &\nanon I must confess that I appear before this distinguished and erudite audience with reasonable\ngrounds for my trepidation. Whereas I feel greatly honoured for this opportunity to speak, I put far\nless weight on your judgement in selecting me to discuss this topic of Reparations for Slavery. I can\nthink of no qualification except perhaps one which can serve me as credential in my support of this\nselection. You are at least, however, entitled to know something about why I have consented to\nshare with you, thoughts on the subjects. You will note that this is purely a personal contribution\nand neither my government nor my country can be held to have endorsed my views on the matter.\nMy government has not express a policy on Reparation. I should commence by pointing out that I\nintend to speak of is a Relationship between an International movement, Pan-Africanism itself very\nelusive of definition on the one hand; and a just Claim for readjustment arising out of one of the\nmost nefarious episode of modern history i.e. Slavery, on the other hand. The single credential that\nI introduce as descriptive of my qualification, is, that I have lived long enough to have observed all\nthe phases of colonialism in a passage through to neo-colonialism which many mistakenly describe\nas Independent. Perhaps I have been removed far enough from the actual period of slavery the better\nto judge its pernicious pervasive and continuous results. I have had the opportunity over these many\nyears of working together with some of our great Pan-Africanists like George Padmore, Dr\nAzikiwe, Kwame Nkrumah, Jomo Kenyatta, the late H. O. A. Davies, T. R. McKonnen and others.\nThis to a great extent made me mentally aware of the full injustices of slavery and enable me to see\nthrough the spectrum of history the relationship between our claim today and the cruelties of\nyesterday out of which this claim arises.\nuand 01\n-\nLand\nHistory shows that this Rape of Africa, for that was what it was, records the transportation\nof the \"finest and the best of Africa's sons\" that they could lay their hand on some millions of us\nacross the Middle Passage to the Caribbean and the Americas. History shows that these Sons of\nAfrica deprived of their language, culture and normal family ties, not to mention what is popularly\nknown today as Human Rights were deprived of the opportunity to develop themselves. One can\neasily conjure up a picture of the million of dead human beings over a three hundred years period,\nthe mountains of corpses who never the chance under slavery to learn even to read or write. It is\ndifficult to forgive and impossible to forget how much talent, how much genius, must have gone to\nwaste. But God is Great and Merciful. We have survived. Climbing up from the bottom of the sea\nof lost opportunity, we are here today. We claim in the name of Justice that descendants of those\nwho have been deprived, should be given the full opportunities of Human Rights and Justice.\nNot only did Africa suffer from the loss of her Sons and Daughters but the Caribbean/America\nand much of the Third World saw these Sons and Daughters struggle against the odds. Up until this\nday, the economy as well as the psychology and lack of technology have left their marks on our\npeople. We seek now a process of readjustment to remove this disfigurement. Justice demands that\nthe present generation of the Third World inhabitants of the south, in the north-south dichotomy be\ngiven relief and their just entitlement.\nOn the emancipation of slavery several millions of pounds sterling was paid as a settlement,\nand to whom was it paid! To the slave masters as compensation. They, were being readjusted for loss\nof property. The slaves whose sinews had helped to build the cities and universities of Britain,\nFrance, Spain and other European countries from the sugar, rum, tobacco, and other produce of the\nsoil, waited many years, indeed generations, for their university and their descendants are still waiting\nfor the technology that will help them to enter the 20th century on more equal terms.\nPan-Africanism to a great extent has been blunted by the need for a common denominator on\nwhich to write the political interest of the various elements of the African diaspora. There has been\nlargely merely the rejection of racial discrimination and a general resentment against a white ruling\nminority that held these groups loosely together. This limitation has severely retarded the drive\nnecessary to alleviate:\n-\nOur failing economy today;\nbozausaib golod sabi sa izu\nyllution to ybod inshasa-a-d\n-abral Our increasing foreign debt today;\n101 noitsbrood ai thodaildings and\nThe widening gap of underdevelopment today;dio animisquam\nThe outdistancing of technological advancement.\n20 kgolonda\nubs no emil smo solet izum inomizulbs ads to a T\nThese are all common denominators of clear political concern.\nWingizni ne ido ai\n100\nOne of our immediate requirements needed now is an aggressive policy of demanding equality\nin educating black technocrats as a pre-condition for the preparations of our people to enter the 20th\ncentury with greater confidence and ability, and equal footing.\n(how a sd bluo\n44\n45",
            "Let me boldly attempt the complexities of definition. Pan-Africanism, as history and study\nwill reveal, has meant different things at different times even to such great Scholars as Dr. W. E. B.\nDubois and the erudite Leopold Senghor whose \"negritude\" emphasized the element of racism. Some\nof these interpretation have consequently set loose emotional argument in full flight but does not\neffect a logical analysis of the subject, sufficient for it to be pursued as a coherent movement. I\nwould, however, say that it includes the following concepts:\nИ\nPan-Africanism can be described as a movement of ideas expressive of cultural unity, political independence\nand the desire to develop Africa and all peoples of African descent on the basis of equality of rights.\nIn the heart of this movement, Africa is the real homeland of all those who are aware of their\ncommitment to our fore-fathers. It is because Pan-Africanism stands for the economic, technological,\nsocial and political advancement of the whole continent of Africa that I find it easy to marry\nconceptually the ideas of Justice and Reparations.\nTibjeg i anw modw of boa\nMay I humbly suggest as another proposal that we utilize this opportunity to analyze study\nand rationalize the basic theoretical principles of the Pan-African movement. Some 10 years ago, I\nwas in a discussion with certain Commonwealth leaders debating what even then, was not a new idea.\nIt may give an indication of one of the forms Reparations could take. Ever since many political\nleaders made successive pilgrimages one after another to representatives of the developed world with\nmonotonous regularity, certain features began to demonstrate with the utmost clarity an attitude of\nmendicancy and deficiencies. The erstwhile masters, at home in London, Paris, or elsewhere, usually\nwere accompanied by carefully selected groups of experts. These specialists provided the resource\nmaterial for the discussion. They provided all the answers. Our leaders - always the petitioners\nusually have little to fall back onto for support. We usually had very little other than Justice and\nemotion on our side. The idea being discussed some 10 years ago was the need for a 3rd World-\nThink-Tank a permanent body of carefully trained specialists from among our own people, set up\nby the establishment in a foundation for research. It would be a resource base to supply our leaders\nwith necessary preparations for their need in such meetings.\nThe process of the adjustment must take some time, for education, technology or otherwise\nis not an \"instant fix\". We are optimistic, however, in the knowledge that even under the heavy\npressures of past and present history, the 3rd World has produced example for brilliance among our\nsons and daughters in every profession. Their achievements have made us proud. Nevertheless, the\nstrain to get there has been great, and unnecessary, and unjust. Today the 3rd World is burdened with\nforeign debts for which no satisfactory solution has yet evolved. The establishment of such a\nfoundation would be a worthy act expressive of sincerity towards the process of solution of that\nproblem.\nA problem to fund such a Research Body could utilize many of our own brilliant sons and\ndaughters graduating annually in the universities of the world with doctorates and degrees in every\npossible subject. I believe the idea in modified form has arisen at various times. The Ex-President -\nGeneral Obasanjo - in his forum expresses it. President Nyerere in his South-South Chairmanship\nhas thought of it. Ambassador Salim, the Secretary General of the O. A. U. is aware of it. Chief\nEmeka Anyaoku, Secretary General of the Commonwealth is admirably poised to project it.\nThere is yet another approach to finding a remedy of redress in this call for Reparation.\nThere are many precedents from history old and recent in which payments of large sums have been\noffered to the Jews, the Japanese - Americans, the Germans and others, to expiate injuries meted\nout to them.\nAt present not only are we suffering from the backward boomerang of earlier under-\ndevelopment, but we are all saddled by the burden of foreign debt - which is to many countries\nclearly impossible of repayment. Up to today no satisfactory solution has evolved in tackling this\nproblem globally. I recommend that our common commitment to the just solution of our present\ndilemma impels us directly to greater efforts of cooperation between governments, institutions and\nother civic associations to request as a first token of sincerity towards Reparations that the chains\nrepresented by Foreign Debts be removed from around our necks. Nigeria could lead this drive on\ncooperation of governments.\nLet me close with the belief that our joint efforts will raise our vision from the plane of\npatient hope, through a plan of action, and on to the higher dimensions of actual expectation and\nachievement.\n46\n47"

            "WHY A.R.M.\nIS PICKETING\nJust under one hundred years ago in 1897 a British expedition attacked Benin\nCity, the capital of an ancient and extensive Empire situated in present day\nNigeria. The British colonial army referred to the conflict as the \"punitive\nexpedition\" because earlier seven univited British officials and traders to that\nregion were ambushed and killed.\nThe Kingdom of Benin had a long history of peaceful relations with European\nnations, but it was the desire of the British to control trade which led them to\nattack this much admired African civilisation.\nThe Benins saw the 1897 event as an evil intrusion to their sovereignty and\nannexation of the region by a foreign power. The then King Oba Ovonramwen\nwas subsequently deposed and sent into exile. Benin city, whose civilization\nand and artefacts dates further back than the 13th century, was almost\ncompletly destroyed. Sacred treasures discovered by the colonial army were\nstripped from their rightful owners, and looted mainly to Britain and then to\nother countries in the West.\nWhen the looted art treasures were brought back to England many of the\nmilitary offices kept collections of their own and the Foreign Office sold\nconsiderable quantities, much of which found it's way to the museums of\nEurope and America.\nThe remarkable quality of the work was rapidly reflected, in high auction room\nprices. The vast majority of the artifacts remain in private collections. The\nForeign Office gave the British Museum a huge quantity of bronze wall\nplaques which depict the history of the Benin Empire in the 15th and 16th\ncenturies. Many are displayed particularly in ethnographic section of these\nmuseums. The premier collection of these priceless Benin art treasures is held\ntoday at the Museum of Mankind.\n89/ARM/4/4",
            "These Museums also retained selling rights of duplicates to the originals,\nwhich of course means that enormous profits have been made. Many famous\nEuropean artists, such as Picasso, have emulated the fine and abstract\ndimensional images found originally in Benin art however not a penny from\ntheir profit has ever gone back to Benin.\nSince independence in 1960, the Nigerian government has made a number of\nunsuccessful requests for the restitution of the artefacts. On several\noccasions, they paid exorbitant prices amounting to thousands of pounds to\nretain possession of some of these artefacts back. Great offence was caused\nwhen the British Museum and British Government refused even the loan of a\nsingle Ivory mask which was to be a visual symbol of a vast pan-African Arts\nFestival in 1977.\nThe looting of artworks in the course of military conflict has been outlawed in\nEurope since the Napoleonic wars, and restitution of looted works within\nEurope enforced. Increasingly, the morality and legality of holding art\ncollections seized by force is being challenged. In the true sense of justice\nand self-determination, the Benin artefacts belong to the culture where they\nwere deprived from. The objects should be a symbol of empowerment to the\noriginal owners. They symbolise historical and social significant which the\naesthetic and monetary value they hold in exile would never compensate.\nThe aim of the demonstration organised by ARM is to bring the injustices of\nthe 1897 event to the public attention. Indeed, the 1897 event is just one of\nmany forms of exploitation and subjugation that Africans had experienced\nunder Europeans powers in the past 500 years\naum\nBy demonstrating, ARM is fighting for justice for people of African descent and\nfor the well-being of human race in general. The demand for the return of such\nartefacts is one expression of the growing movement for reparations for Africa.\nFor further information, please contact :\nAfrica Reparations Movement (UK) 081-880-9100"

They are saying to me,\n\"It's time we left this country. It's time we\nwere voluntarily repatriated.\"\nThe meeting was called to examine\nPowell's 1968 forecast that by 1993\nBritain would be torn apart by bloody\nracial conflict unless Black people\nreturned to their countries of origin.\nMr Grant said he was no longer sure that\nPowell had been entirely wrong.\n\"There was something in what Powell\nsaid.\"\n\"I believe there is going to be a lot of\ntrouble in the future.'\nHe added: \"Where as I wouldn't go so\nfar as to say that Powell was right, I think\nhe predicted something that is beginning\nto happen. and I suspect his words will\ncome true, unless strong action is taken.\"\nThe issue of repatriation is \"something I\nhave to consider,\" he admitted. \"I haven't\ncome down on one side or the other.\"\nPeople who have approached him have\nsaid that they would insist on public\nmoney to help them immigrate.

This attack was\nonly prevented by local people. In France a Moroccan youth was\nkilled by an assassin who said he had made a 'mistake' because he\nthought that he had fired at a Chinese, and a survey conducted in\nMarch last year found that 76% of those questioned felt that the\nbehaviour of some North Africans justified racist reactions\nagainst them. In Italy, at the end of February 1990 at carnival\nnight in Florence, about 200 masked people with baseball bats and\niron bars organised a beating of blacks and gypsies in the town\ncentre; in May 1988 in Rome, an Italian woman of Eritrean origin\nwas told by a white male who was supported by nearly all the other\npassengers, to give up her seat to a white.

All this takes place in a political arena in\nand is achieving success in local &\nwhich the far right has grown in alarming proportions, In fact\nnational clections\nFinland is the only country where the extreme right party, the\nSuomen\nMaaseudun Puolue (SMP Country Party of Finland is\ndeclining.

However, since the Council considers this to be only\na \"declaration of principle\", the \" \" basis on which we work\", The\nReport states 'the Joint Declaration has remained, \"sheets of\npaper\".\nThe Eurobarometer study on racism and xenophobia in the European\ncommunity was conducted in October and November 1988 and its\nfindings presented to the European Parliament in November 1989.\nOne in three Europeans thinks that there are too many people of\nanother nationality or race in his or her country and many felt.\nthe presence of immigrants to be a negative factor for the future.\nIt concludes: 'It is now up to the European Institutions to take\nthe appropriate measures in the field of integration and tolerance\nof people with different nationality, race, religion and culture,\ntaking the direction indicated by the opinion of the majority of\nEC citizens.'\n९",
            ")\nHOUSE OF COMMONS\nLONDON SW1A 0AA\nPOINT OF DISCUSSION 1.\n(Joint action required for the future.)\nThe progress on combating racism and xenophobia in Europe has been\nslow, despite the insights provided by the Ford Report. I was\npresent when the Report was presented to the European Parliament,\nand it got through only narrowly. While Europe dithers, the forces\nof reaction continue to group in Europe, and this makes it even\nmore urgent that firm action is taken immediately to deal with the\nmatter. In some quarters much time is spent on studying the\nactivities of the far right. I am firmly of the view that much of\nenergy needs to be diverted to the taking of positive steps\nstudies\nthis\n-\nto address the situation. We know the racists are there\nare of little use to black people when they are being attacked on\nthe streets.\nThere are three particular recommendations of the Ford Report\nwhich I believe are of the greatest importance.\nThe first of these is the granting of the right to vote., and to\nstand in elections. At present much of Europe's black and minority\npopulation, with the exception of Britain, is denied the right to\nor to stand\nvote, either in local or national elections. Those people are\nΛ\nexpected to pay their taxes to the Governments of Europe, but\ndenied any say in the politics of those Governments.\ntotally unacceptable.\nThere must be no taxation\nThis is\nwithout\nrepresentation.\n4",
            "HOUSE OF COMMONS\nLONDON SW1A 0AA\nNot only is the present position morally indefensible, but it also.\namounts to the exclusion of black and minority ethnic people from\nthe political process. They are rendered powerless, and denied the\nmeans of expressing their views and pressing their needs. If we\ndeny people a role in\nrole in the political process, then we cannot be\nsurprised if they find other means of expression which we do not\nthe involvement of minority communities\nlike. In Britain, unlike in other countries in Europe, this\nhas begun. We have hundreds of black councillors\ngovernment, and four black M.P.'s. Dy\nA process in the\nin local\nPolitical\nIn contrast, our\nbrothers and sisters in Europe are in a desperate state. I cannot\nbelieve that if black people had the vote in Europe, that some of\nthe conditions which I have seen in Europe could possibly exist. I\nwould cite the example of Portugal where I was a few days ago.\nBlack people there are living in slum conditions you would not\nbelieve existed in Europe.\nThe second recommendation of the Ford\nFord Report which must be\nimplemented without fail, is that countries must tighten their\nlaws against racism and anti-semitism . In my view what is needed\nis the establishment of a Race Relations Act, together with a body\nwhich will monitor that Act. In Europe, black and minority ethnic\npeople can be discriminated against in all areas of life, and they\nhave no legal redress. The racists and fascists know that they can\npursue their prejudices without fear of redress. Racial\ndiscrimination must be made an offence as it is in Britain where\n(5)",
            "HOUSE OF COMMONS\nLONDON SW1A 0AA\nwe have had a Race Relations Act in force for twenty years or so,\nand we have a Commission For Racial Equality which is charged with\nenforcing the Act. The Act is not perfect and needs improving, but\nit has served to eliminate much overt racism in Britain, by\nbringing perpetrators before the courts. Such legislation must be\nestablished on a European wide basis, and\nand there\nthere must be an\nenforcement body which has real teeth to make sure that it works.\nof\nThe third most important recommendation of the Ford Report which\nmust be implemented is that which refers to education\nto education and the\ncurriculum in our schools. The values which are implied in so much\nthe curriculum in European schools, and the stereotypes of\nblack and minority ethnic groups which are conveyed are again\nquite unnacceptable. Nowhere is this more vital than in the\nteaching of history, and of Europe's role in the world in the\npast. Studies of the curriculum undertaken in Britain and\nelsewhere reveal the most disgraceful eurocentrism, and frequently\nportray black people as less than human. An obscene manifestation\nof that will be well apparent in 1992 itself, when we shall see\ncrude celebrations to mark the so-called \"discovery\" of America by\nChristopher Columbus. This is matter which must be addressed if\nwe are not to continue to impart such untruths to future\ngenerations of Europeans. Every country in Europe must be obliged\nto review its curriculum from this point of view, and black and\nminority ethnic people must be involved in that review. Ignorance\nbreeds racism, and we must stop giving it life in the schools of",
            "Europe.\nHOUSE OF COMMONS\nLONDON SW1A 0AA\nPOINT OF DISCUSSION 2.\n(Structures and networks to combat racism in Europe)\nabout by\nThe defeat of racism in the new Europe can only come\nmeans of a co-ordinated cross national effort. So far there are\nfew signs of that happening. Only the churches have taken a\ncontinuing interest\nin the matter, and they are to be\ntired of\ncongratulated for it. My own view is that whatever structures\n1they\nemerge must involve and consult black people. Black people\npeople are\nof going\ngoing to conferences on Racism in Europe which are\nconceived, planned and dictated by the white majority population on\ntheir behalf They are often patronising in the extreme, and miss\nthe key issues of concern to us, however well intended. We are no\nlonger content to sit and listen while we are talked about. We\nmust be a part of the discussion. Along side this, it is\nfora\n•\nnecessary for there to be where the black communities in\nEurope can come together to discuss their concerns together, free\nfrom the pressures of others. No such structure exists at present,\nalthough I hope that the work which I am involved in will change\nthat soon. We want to sit down together to discuss our situation,\nand how we should respond to it politically. We want to be able to\ntalk with others too who share the same experience as oppressed\nminorities elsewhere in\nin the world e.g. the Aboriginals, the\nMaoris, the Ennuit, and even some of the ethnic groups in Eastern",
            "HOUSE OF COMMONS\nLONDON SW1A 0AA\nEurope. From my own dealings with black and minority communities\naround Europe, I can tell you that there are marked similarities\nin our experience, and that we very badly need to be able to talk\ntogether about strategies for dealing with this situation. Many of\ncommunities are small isolated and powerless, and eager to\nlearn as to how in Britain we have devised strategies to cope with\nthe racism we have experienced.\nthe\nPOINT OF DISCUSSIONS 3.\n( Initiatives to remember the victims of racism in 2nd World War)\nOf course, we must all agree that the holocaust and the oppression\nof Jewish people in the thirties and forties in Europe must be\nremembered and commemorated. So too must the oppression of other\ngroups in history, in particular those upon whose backs the wealth\nof Europe was built. I should like for example the history of the\nMiddle Passage, and the deaths of millions of Africans transported\nas slaves to\nto be equally commemorated, and researched in\nsystematic way. The European\nCommunity must fund those\ninitiatives.\na\nPOINT FOR DISCUSSION 4.\n(Responsibility for places of remembrance)\nHere I would say only this. Every single person who is killed by\nreason of\nof racist attack should have a memorial. It should be a\ncivic responsibility for such memorials to be put\nto be put in place, in\nprominent positions. We need the fascists to be reminded of what\n8",

Despite promises of freedom of\nmovement and equality of opportunity, there is no reason to\nbelieve that ethnic minorities will receive fair and equal\ntreatment. On the contrary, the rapid resurgence of racism and\nfascism, the growing resistance to immigration from Africa,\nAsia and the Carribean, and the daily experience of black\npeople across Europe, confirm that the European Community\nthreatens to reduce their rights and worsen the conditions\nunder which they live.\nOver forty UK organisations have therefore decided to come\ntogether as a Standing Conference on Racial Equality in Europe\nto:\n*\n*\n*\n*\nco-operate in the exchange and dissemination of\ninformation about issues of concern to members of black\nand ethnic minority communities, including refugees and\nasylum seekers, in Europe;\nwork for equality of condition for all those resident in\nmember states of the European Community, regardless of\ntheir colour, race, nationality, ethnic or national\norigins, or religion%;B\npromote both action and legislation which will ensure\nequal treatment for black and migrant communities, and\noutlaw discrimination, in:\nimmigration to, and freedom of movement within, the\nEuropean Community%;B\nthe treatment of asylum seekers and refugees;\nthe right to family life, including family reunion;\nthe criminal justice system;B\naccess to and the provision of training, employment\nand capital;\naccess to and the provision of goods and services;\nand\naccess to and the provision of education, housing,\nhealth and other social services%;B",
            "*\n*\nor\npromote legislation which will outlaw harassment,\nincitement to racial hatred or violence, whether by\nindividuals, the media, or political or other\norganisations%3B and to\nliaise and cooperate with all groups and organisations\nwith equivalent aims throughout the European Community.\nMembership is open to all organisations which support the aims\nand objectives of SCORE (UK). I am writing as Chair of the\nStanding Conference\nConference to invite your organisation to take up\nmembership, and to attend the inaugural meeting, which will\ntake place on Saturday 24th. November 1990 in Birmingham.\nMembership will allow you to play a full part in a positive\ncampaigning organisation working for real action on issues of\ngrowing importance to black and ethnic minority groups\nthroughout Europe. A fast and efficient information service\nwill provide member organisations with the information on the\ndevelopments in Europe which are increasingly affecting the\nlives of black people in Britain.\nI sincerely hope you will want to be part of this important\ninitiative.\nBernie Grant\nBernie Grant MP.\n1/00816/SC/003"

The organisation aims\nto bring together Africans in Europe, both for their own mutual\nsupport, and to provide a voice for Africa in Europe.\nI am of the view that a forum of this kind is of crucial\nimportance in the context of\ncontext of the \"New World Order\", and of the\nadvent of the Single European Market on 1st January 1993.\nWith the demise of the Soviet Union, and the reform of Eastern\nEurope, the threat to Africa's prosperity has never been so great.\nThe exploitation and under-investment by the countries of the\nNorth looks set to worsen, and Africa's prospects are bleak.\nAfrican people in Europe will also face further racism and\ndiscrimination as a result of the Single European Market, and the\nspectre of a \"fortress Europe\".\nGiven the global restructuring of the economic and political\nagenda, it is vital in my opinion that Africans wherever they are,\nbegin to work together to support Africa, in a way which has never\nhappened before.\nWith this in mind, the O.A.E. has suggested that it would highly\nbeneficial if I were to attend the next 0.A.U. meeting in Senegal\nas an observer, to begin the process of opening up dialogue.\nI would be extremely grateful if you would use your good offices\nto enable me to do so.

But without Smith and\nDavis, both of whom have\nplayed for England, Arsenal's\ntask of achieving its first\nchampionship since 1971 may\nprove too great.\n\"It's come at a crucial time\nand it's a bad blow consider-\ning what has happened to\nAlan Smith,\" said Davis, who\nhas only been back in the Ar-\nsenal side for three weeks.\n\"We are still confident we will\nget the title, but these are two\nsetbacks we could have done\nwithout.\"\nArsenal manager George\nGraham tried to play down the\nabsence of Smith, but admit-\nted the timing could not have\nbeen worse.\n\"I have still got plenty of\noptions available,\" Graham\nsaid. \"Obviously it's too early\nto suggest exactly when Alan\nmight be fit again, and his loss\nat such an important stage of\nthe season is a real setback\nfor us.\"\nFrank McLintock, who cap-\ntained the Arsenal team that\nlast won the title, said the only\nway to success was by being\npositive.

But man-\nagement is still a closed door to\nthem. Now they are about to\nchallenge the almost all-white\nhierarchy which runs the sport.\nBy John Tufail-Ali\nWHEN Gordon Bennett, secretary of Brit-\nain's West Bromwich Albion Football\nClub, began the laborious task of reading\nthrough more than 50 applications for the\npost of manager, it never crossed his\nmind that he was about to read a little\npiece of football history.\nAmong many applications the one from for-\nmer West Brom player Brendon Batson. was\nmost impressive. If Batson had been appointed\nhe would have been the first black applicant in\nEurope to be appointed manager of a League\nfootball team.\nForty years after people from The Caribbe-\nan were first encouraged to enter Britain to alle-\nviate the job shortage, and 15 years after black\nfootballers finally began to break into League\nfootball, black professional footballers are\nready to enter the highest echelons of the foot-\nball hierarchy club management.\nSport of all kinds in the West is dominated\nat senior administrative, coaching and manage-\nrial levels by white males. Before the Seven-\nties, the only genuine black \"star\" in Britain\nfootball, Lindy Delephena, played for most of\nhis career for clubs in seaport towns. He was\nvociferously helped by black supporters in\ntowns that had mercantile links with Africa and\nThe Caribbean.\nMost coaches, players and managers agree\nthat the self-confidence engendered has\nhelped black players make their mark at the\nhighest levels of the game.\nGarth Crooks, first black player to become\nchair of the Professional Footballers Associa-\ntion, explained: \"Racism in the form of stereo-\ntyping among key occupation groups, manag-\ners, scouts, coaches and sportswriters, was\nfairly common during the Fifties and Sixties.\n\"Despite the success of black players in\nBrazil, for example, they were somehow 'un-\nsuitable' for the British game. They were too\n'flash or individualistic', 'not team orientated.'\nBlack players, it was heard, 'lacked bottle.'\nThey couldn't cope with the 'rigours of the Brit-\nish winter.'\nThese ludicrous sterotypes were carried on\nFive black stars\nMark\nChamberlain\nPortsmouth FC.\nGarth Crooks\nCharlton F.C.\nFirst black chair\nCyrille Regis\nCoventry City\nCoaching\nto the terraces via the sports pages of national\nand local newspapers. They were put forward\nas \"decisive arguments\" in sports journals as to\nwhy black players would never make a real im-\npact on the game.\nThey had a debilitating effect on black foot-\nballers. Said Crooks: \"Loss of confidence in a\nplayer is just as devastating as physical injury,\nand often more effective in ruining a career.\ndifficult for black players to develop the mental\n\"Negative stereotyping of this kind made it\nstate so important in the professional game -\nthe ability to dominate your position.\"\nToday, however, these stereotypes have\nlong disappeared from professional football.\n\"The game has grown up a lot in the past\n20 years,\" said Crooks. \"Managers and coach-\nes have become much more sophisticated in\ntheir approach. They recognise the important\npart psychology has to play in the game - and\nthey also recognise the need not to lose good\nplayers.\"\nHowever, racism persists. It continues to\nhave an impact on the development of black\nfootballers, although its most blatant manifes-\nViv Anderson\nManchester Utd.\nLuther Blissett\nWatford F.C.\ntations are on the perimeters of the game and\non the terraces, rather than among players and\nmanagement.\nTerry Murphy, youth development officer\nfor Division One high-flyers Arsenal and a for-\nmer teacher, says: \"The one area where I have\nreally encountered racism has been in finding\nlodgings for young black apprentices.\n\"Responses such as 'I wouldn't mind my-\nself, it's the neighbours you know,' are all too\ncommon. It makes it difficult to bring young\nblack players from outside the area into the\nclub.\"\nGarth Crooks identified another area of ra-\ncism: the press. He was particularly bitter\nabout the coverage of a recent FA Cup game\nbetween West Ham United and Arsenal, in\nwhich several black players participated.\nA reporter covering the match, won through\na goal by West Ham's young black striker, Le-\nroy Rosenoir, chose to use blatant voodoo im-\nagery as a metaphor for the West Ham victory.\nPunning Rosenoir's name, the writer called\nhim a \"black rose\" (\"a dark omen in French\nWest Africa as the footballer from Sierra Leone\ncast his fateful shadow over Highbury last\nnight\") and said players \"stood as if suddenly\ntransfixed by pins jabbed into their effigies.\"\nDaily Mail Sports Editor, Peter Moss, ex-\npressed surprise that the article may have\ncaused offence. The article was \"only a joke\"\nadding that he thought that \"anybody finding\noffence in the story must be looking for trou-\n.ble.\"\nBut perhaps the most revealing comment\nMoss made was: \"Didn't you think it odd, the\nway the Arsenal defence just froze when Ro-\nsenoir scored?\" He concluded: \"The article is\ndefinitely not racist, not in any way.\"\nBoth Crooks and the Commission of Racial\nEquality (CRE) begged to differ. \"It was a dis-\ngraceful piece of journalism,\" said Crooks. \"We\nshall be writing to Mr Moss expressing our dis-\napproval in the strongest possible terms,\" said\nthe CRE.\nToday the almost exclusively white hierar-\nchy in football is about to face a new chal-\nlenge. Said Crooks: \"The game's management\nis moving near to the days when the genera-\ntion of black players I grew up with, will wish to\nmove into management. Already at least one\nplayer has applied for a job at his old club\".\nCrooks believes it is inevitable that a black\nmanager will emerge. Brendon Batson, now\ndeputy chief executive of the PFA, has made\nlittle secret of his desire to move into manage-\nment.\nAnother possible is the Bournemouth and\nformer England striker, Luther Blisset. At Cov-\nentry another black striker, Cyrille Regis, has\nalready been appointed into a coaching posi-\ntion often considered the first step into man-\nagement.\nCrooks and Batson have already gone\nsome way towards opening the door into ad-\nministration for black players. Crooks has rap-\nidly acquired the administrative and diplomatic\nskills essential to his post and has achieved\nreal stature.\nAbility\nHe recognises he has a special responsibil-\nity: \"I'm sure there must be one or two people\nout there just waiting for me to fall flat on my\nface, so they can say 'it was bound to happen'.\nThe most important element in racism is fear,\ninsecurity and personal inadequacy\".\nBatson points to the American experience\nwhere, although at least 50% of gridiron foot-\nballers are black, administrative and coaching\nis dominated by whites.\nThe signs are promising that British football\nwill not follow the pattern of gridiron football in\nthe US. The next few months or years will tell.\nWhen black footballers do break into man-\nagement, they will do so purely on the basis of\ntheir own ability, which they have forced the in-\nsular, almost claustrophobic, world of football\nto acknowledge. They will also have delivered\nanother blow in the battle against racism and\nprejudice.",

They were kept busy with\na series of incidents which occurred before\na clash between a mob of black youths and\nsome white skinheads in the early hours\nlead to police intervention.\nFlashpoints\nTHERE are two principal flashpoints of\ntrouble in High Wycombe, the 'multi-racial'\ncentre used almost exclusively by the Afro-\nCaribbean members of the town's 12,000\nethnic minority residents, and the Turnpike,\na pub which has, since the closure recently\nof another trouble-torn pub, become the\ndrinking resort for many of the unruly\nelement in the black community.\nJust before midnight, with the Turnpike\npacked to the doors, the licensee called in\nthe police because fights had broken out\namong the crowd of over 200 predomin-\nantly black customers. About six officers at-\ntended, and by the use of great tact\n('grovelling' one officer half jokingly des-\ncribed it to me), they managed to empty the\npremises.\n\"We got away with that one,\" said Sgt\nPeter Bentall, \"one spark and it could have\nbeen very different.\"\nAnother officer said that the tension sur-\nrounding the Turnpike incident had been\nvery high. \"You can sus out the at-\nmosphere,\" he said. \"When you're met\nwith overt hostility and antagonism along\nwith vicious verbal abuse you know you're\nnot dealing with a friendly crowd. If we'd\nsaid or done anything out of place, it would\nhave been very nasty.\"\nHard core\n\"\nSUCH sentiments, commonplace enough\namong police officers in inner city areas,\nsound odd when voiced about High\nWycombe, a town which epitomises the\nsuccess story of the south east, with a\nminimal unemployment rate. The trouble,\nsays the divisional commander, Chief\nSuperintendent J. L. Dewhurst, is confined\nto a hard core of around 200 Afro-\nCaribbean youths, all unemployed and\n22\nlargely unemployable, who live by petty and\nnot so petty crime and infest the town cen-\ntre, bent on mischief. Members of this\ngroup who made the anti-police remarks in\nthe local paper blame the local educational\nsystem for their plight, and in this they are\nchampioned by their youth worker, a Ms\nSue Little, who told the paper: \"Our school\nsystem certainly doesn't do them justice.\nA lot of them have no qualifications even\nthough they are very bright young people.\"\nnce Bookmakers\n-09 to emeldo\nFracas ied\ndejovst\nmupis ati\nVevel\nw sig\nnoirlast philleggs on not A\nIT was around 1.50am on New Year's Day\nwhen a fracas occurred outside The\nAnchor pub, opposite the multi-racial cen-\ntre. The centre's New Year's Eve attrac-\ntion was a Disco Dancing championship,\nwhich had drawn groups of young blacks\nfrom surrounding areas and places like\nLuton and Brixton. The local police have\nno doubt that some of those who turned\nup were looking for trouble, and it came\nunexpectedly in the shape of a fierce argu-\nment with a group of skinheads who had\nbeen drinking at The Anchor.\n\"The skinheads started it, an officer told\nme. \"They claim that an older man was\nmugged by a black guy, but it's more likely\nthat they started taunting the blacks who\nsuddenly came out mob handed. They were\nANCHO\nINN\nAnchor Inn\nHundreds of young blacks attacked the Anchor pub after a clash with skinheads.\nLocal tradespeople have complained bit-\nterly about the activities of some of these\n'bright young people' who have adopted the\ntechnique known as 'steaming'. The\nmanager of one High Street shop speaks of\ngangs of black youths who make forays into\nshops with carrier bags, and immediately\nsplit up into small groups, making it impossi-\nble for staff to watch all of them at the\nsame time. \"These visits always involve\ntheft, or the 'placing' of goods for later\ntheft. They are getting bolder all the time\nbecause no one dares to try and stop\nthem.\" He has written to the police de-\nmanding a more visible police presence in\nthe shopping centre, but with present man-\npower problems it is unlikely that extra\npatrols can be provided.\nThe front page story in a local paper\nwhich came out on New Year's Eve was:\nBlack kids warn of rift with police. The\npaper claimed: \"The streets of High\nWycombe could become another Brixton if\nrelations between police and young blacks\ndon't improve.\" One black youth claimed:\n\"They can only push us so far. If we see\ntwo Old Bill going round town we will\nmouth them and if they go too far we will\nlace them up.\" The bravado underlying the\nboast recalls an incident outside the multi-\nracial centre in the summer, when PC lan\nButcher was stabbed by one of a crowd of\nyouths following the pursuit of a stolen\nmotor cycle.\nwell tooled up with weapons they fetched\nfrom the boots of their cars, including iron\nbars and shotguns.\" The police suspect that\nthe clash with the skinheads was no more\nthan an unexpected diversion for those\nblacks whose real purpose all along had\nbeen to pick a fight with the law.\nPolice estimate that about two hundred\nblack youths attacked The Anchor, throw-\ning stones and breaking the pub's windows.\nThe police were called, and it is their alleg-\ned tardiness in arriving on the scene that is\nat the hub of local complaints. The pub\nlandlord claims that it was not until forty\nfive minutes after he dialled 999 that the\npolice arrived.\nDelay\nTHE police accept that there was a delay\nof about half an hour before they moved in\nto disperse the mob and make arrests. A\npolice spokesman told the Daily Express\n\"We didn't have enough men to deal with\nthe situation. We acted as soon as we re-\nceived the 999 call and set up observers at\nthe scene. There was no way we were go-\ning in there with just a handful of policemen,\nwhich is all we had on duty. We decided\nto get back-up from other divisions.\"\nThe small group of officers held back in\nthe High Street said it was not pleasant\nto be told by members of the public flee-\n(continued on page 24)",

It is a non-political, family organisation, which was born\nout of a desire to emphasise the positive aspects of Caribbean\nculture. There was particular concern about the fact that young\nsecond generation Caribbean people knew little about the Caribbean\nand its culture, and about the need for them to have positive\nimages of and pride in their history. The organisation is open to\nanyone with an interest in the Caribbean of any race.\nDespite its meagre resources, Caribbean Links has\nLinks has already\norganised a number of functions, including two Family Fun Days\neach year, which have been attended by several hundred people.\nAlso, since one of the aims is to link up people with an interest\nin the Caribbean nation-wide, the organisation recently organised\na weekend excursion to Liverpool, in conjunction with the\nCaribbean Community there, incorporating a visit to the\nTransatlantic Slavery Museum there. This was a huge success and\nshows the potential of the organisation. We did manage to get\nsponsorship from Barclays Bank for this trip which I think shows\nthat Caribbean Links is no way out political pressure group !\n-\nWhat Caribbean Links needs is some money to employ someone to\ndevelop the organisation, and something towards some basic running\ncosts. At present everything is done by volunteers, using Bernie's\noffice resources - not something which we want to continue.",

I didn't get your phone number by the way,\ncall me to fix a time to meet.\nso do\nYours sincerely,\nSHARON LAWRENCE\nP.A. TO BERNIE GRANT M.P.\nP.S.

In the letter, Mr Kos, presumably acting on behalf of\nHeineken, appears to be insisting on a number of alterations to\nthe Hotel Babylon show.\nPoint 5 in Mr Kos' letter complains that \"there was a too high\nproportion of negroes\" in the Hotel Babylon audience.\nI find it quite incredible that the racial composition of an\naudience should be a matter on which a sponsor should seek to\npressurise a production company. As a multi- national company,\nmany of whose customers around the world are black, I am shocked\nthat Heineken has apparently sought to exercise editorial\ninfluence along racist lines.\nMr Kos's letter is bound to cause outrage amongst Britain's black\ncommunities, and I feel sure that it will provoke ill feeling\ntowards Heineken. I have been asked by the press to comment on the\nletter, but would like to offer you this opportunity to explain\nHeineken's position before this matter escalates.\nI look forward to hearing from you.\nYours sincerely,\nBERNIE GRANT MP\nMember of Parliament for Tottenham\nFax: 081-880-9100",

My\ncolleagues and I, within the Executive Board of Heineken, are truly\nimpressed with your generous public statement after receiving my letter.\nIn your response you have suggested Heineken to show its good will by\nmaking a donation to African-owned charity organizations. My colleagues\nand I have given this - and similar suggestions made by a number of\norganizations - a great deal of serious thought. After all we have\nunintentionally offended a large number of people.\nHowever, we feel that simply donating money will justifiably be seen as\nbuying off guilt in the sense that 'you can get away with anything as long\nas you have the money'. Secondly we are convinced that credibility cannot\nand should not be bought, but earned by the Heineken company in day to\nday business.

This is in spite of the tremendous contribution made by soldiers,\nsailors and airmen from these areas to the achievement of victory in Europe and thus the\nfreedom of Britain from Nazi domination.\ndoes\nThe main reason given for this ungrateful decision is that the contributions of these\nterritories were not at brigade strength, which can be anything from 5,000 to 15,000\nmen. Yet there were 374,000 East and West African troops mostly fighting the Italians in\nNorth Africa, clearly part of the struggle to free Europe: so how many brigades\nthat make? Moreover, 10,000 men and women came over from the Caribbean to assist the war\neffort,\nmany giving their lives fighting the Germans in Europe. Of the 30,000 merchant\nseamen, who gave their lives keeping Britain supplied with food and armaments, 5,000\nwere colonial sailors, one sixth of the total.\nJust one of the 6,000 West Indians who served in the RAF in Britain was Squadron Leader\nP. Ulric Cross. He was awarded both the DSO and DFC after flying \"a very large number of\nsorties, most of which have been against such heavily defended targets as Berlin,\nHamburg, Ludwingshaven and industrial centres in the Ruhr area. ... a brave and resolute\nmember of aircraft crew, whose exceptional navigational ability has been an important\nfactor in the successes obtained\" to quote from his D60 citation. Truly a member of the\nfew who gave so much for so many. As High Commissioner for Trinidad & Tobago until a few\nmonths ago, he would have been known to many of the Commemoration Team; did John Major\nrecognise England's debt when he shook the hand of this hero turned diplomat?\nShould not England also acknowledge the innumerable tanks, ambulances and mobile\ncanteens paid for by public subscription in the then colonies?\nFor example, Trinidad,\nwith\ntotal population of less than half a million, had donated $2.8 million by 31\nMarch 1943, even though the average daily wage, for those fortunate enough to have\njob, was about $1 equivalent to 24 pence.\nIn spite of the immense contribution made by black soldiers, sailors and airmen in what\nwas essentially a European tribal war, recreation units for troops on leave such as the\nUnion Jack Club operated a colour bar, and such was the racism that in 1947 the Labour\nGovernment had to set up\nthe British Colonies Club in Trafalgar Square SO that\n\"coloured\" troops could relax in peace. This was managed by Paul and Carmen England,\nherself from Trinidad, until the incoming Tory Government pusillanimously closed it down\nin 1952. It seems that, as far as English gratitude and racism is concerned, nothing has\nchanged.\nYours faithfully,\nDavid Roussel-Milner",

This story is completely false. Two weeks ago you\npublished a story headlined \"Bernie's banter is baffling\" which said that\nI had caused uproar over a scheme to introduce Creole teaching in Haringey\nschools. I have not been involved in any such discussions with anybody;\nthe story in fact was about Haringey Community Relations Council, a body\nthat I am not connected with. The CRC is an independent body, entirely\nseparate from the local authority: Haringey Council.\nThese stories, firstly misrepresent my position on matters, and secondly\nsuggest that everything that happens in Haringey even by bodies not con-\nnected with the Council, is my doing.\nMore seriously, the effect and context of this misreporting panders to\nracism. The Black community in Britain is not well served by the national\npress. When its fears and aspirations are misreported by that press, or\nheld up to ridicule as they have been in the two examples I have given,\nthere is a racist backlash. The hate mail which I receive every time\nFleet Street misrepresents Black people, their culture and anti-racist\npolicies is evidence of this.\nYours sincerely\nBernie Grant\nLeader of the Council",

No significant consensus\nexists, however, on the root causes of\nthis national scandal or on how it can\nbe radically changed. This dangerous\nuncertainty not only bedevils the nation\nbut threatens to dramatically erode support\nfor the Labour Party in the Black community.\nAs far as Labour is concerned, part of\nthe solution must lie in encouraging far\ngreater involvement of Black people in the\naffairs of the Labour Party. Sadly though,\nthe old methods have failed. Years of\nindifference, neglect and racism have\ncreated a situation where potential Black\nmembers of the Party ask themselves: \"Why\nget involved in an organisation which,\ndespite its rhetoric around election time,\nsuggests by its every public act and image\nthat Black people play no part in it?\"\nNot surprisingly, many Black people\nconclude there is no point and throw away\nthe application form. Yet Black people\nare well aware that Labour was created\nto fight for the rights of the disadvant-\nAnd\naged, the poor and the powerless.\ngiven that we fall into all these categ-\nories, the majority of us continue to\ngive it our support. But we do so despite\nour concern that the Party ia as sus-\nceptible to racism as all other insti-\ntutions in Britain today.\nIt is this position we wish to change\nthrough Black self-organisation.\nNo one\nwould deny us this right in the communities\nwhere we live. Now we demand the same\nright to organise in the Party which enjoys\nour overwhelming support.\nBlack activists involved in the struggle\nfor Black Sections take the view that, as\nwith women and their struggle against\nsexism in the Party, Black members of the\nParty, where they so desire, ought to be\nable to establish constitutionally-recog-\nnised groups.\nThose that already exist\nhave ensured that frank and full discussion\nof issues that affect Black people take\nplace and proper programmes of action are\ndevised. It is no good arguing this\nwill divide the working class. Racism\nand imperialism have historically divided\nBlack Sections are a political means\nof healing the divide because they enable\nus to speak on our own behalf. We are\nnot asking for special treatment simply\nparity with every other section of the\nParty.\nus.\nBlack Sections are not the sole solution,\nbut we believe they will make a major\nimpact on the ability of Black socialists\nto gain a confidence in the Labour Party\nupon which collective political action\ncan be built.\nOur view is that this process will re-\nvitalise and strengthen the Party and\ncampaigning issues will end up being\ndiscussed throughout. Let us be clear.\nWe are not talking abour creating 'ghettoes'\nas some opponents have suggested. We are\nabour building an unobstructed avenue for\nBlack expression in the Party.\nThrough the creation of Black Sections we\nbelieve Labour will enable the real causes\nof racism to be aired and fully understood.\nMore importantly, Black Sections will make\nsure that those who bear the heaviest\nbrunt of racism in society can at last\nplay a direct role in its eradication.\nThis is particularly so in the inner cities\nwhere Labour relies so heavily on the\nBlack vote but does so little to deserve it.\nWe say that by direct participation\nthrough Black Sections, we as Black people\nwill at last be able to represent our\nproblems thoughts and aspirations by\nourselves are argue for change without\nrecourse to white middlemen broking on\nour behalf.\nSUPPORT BLACK SECTIONS NOW\nPublished by the Black Sections\nNational Committee",

It is extremely unfortu-\nnate if you have black parliamentary candi-\ndates getting carried away at unruly meet-\nings. Some people said things at the\nBirmingham conference that shouldn't\nto David\nSelbourne about\ngetting Labour\ninto government\nhave been said.\"; Linda Bellos, Lambeth's\nleader, had shouted: \"We don't want white\nmembers of the Labour Party to speak for\nus,\" and there was the usual talk of \"white\nLabour MPs\" Roy Hattersley in\nSparkbrook for one \"riding on our backs\nin their rotten boroughs\".\n-\n-\nBut you have said the same kind of\nthings, haven't you? \"First, we as blacks\nspeak a different language,\" Mr Grant an-\nswered, arousing for a moment, but still\nsoftly, the ghost of PC Blakelock. \"Second,\nnobody understands the pressure black\ncandidates are under.\"\nSuch as? \"Pressure from the party\nleadership\" - \"sending us disgraceful let-\nters to stay away from Birmingham\" is how\nhe put it \"from our own black activists\npressing us, pressure from the media\". This\nmany-sided pressure (driving black spokes-\nmen to \"say things they do not mean\"), Mr\nGrant called, sighing, a \"heavy scene\".\nNo doubt it is. But in particular, Mr\nGrant has it in for Gwyneth Dunwoody,\nMP for Crewe, and (white) member of the\nbogged-down Black and Asian Sub-com-\nmittee of Labour's NEC. This is the party\nrulebook's \"constitutional\" alternative to\nunseemly black agitation; strangely forgot-\nten, though not in black circles, is that\nLarry Whitty, the party's general secretary,\nnow mulling over the question of \"disci-\nplinary action\", was himself once an advo-\ncate of separate black sections.\nT\nhe \"right wing\" Mrs Dunwoody\nhas said of the black activists that\nthey, out of political \"ambition\",\nare \"making a great deal of noise\nwithout a great deal of thought\". Mr Grant\nsays of her that \"she is the kind of person\nwho will leave the Labour Party\". Roy\nHattersley, who has pitched in against\nblack sections (\"equivalent to political\nAids\") with the energy of a man possessed,\nMr Grant cannot bring himself to call by\nname. \"With a bit of luck,\" Mr Grant said\nunder his breath, \"he may also leave the\nparty.\"\nNot in doubt, however, is that \"the strug-\ngle will continue\". What struggle? (Here,\nCouncillor Lawrence, in a large flamboyant\nnecklace, listened more intensely than\never, hawk-eared lest Bernie put his foot in\nit.) \"The struggle to deal with racial disad-\nParty that this struggle will go on. When we\nare in Parliament, that struggle will be\nheightened. We can promise you that,\" he\nadded, lightly tapping the table.\n1\nI\nS\nV\nC\nV\ni\nW\nr\nW\nt\nd\nW\nt\nP\nSa\nM\nL\nra\ng\nW\nr\na\n\"They can proscribe black sections, but\nthey will never keep the issue of black\nrepresentation out of the Labour party. a\nDunwoody and whoever can't just rubbish\nwhat we are saying. Whatever the Labour\nParty does on racial disadvantage will have\nto be acceptable to its black MPs. It can't\nhave a policy on race and leave me out of\nit.\"\nAnd a black parliamentary caucus? \"No-\nbody will stop us sitting and talking\ntogether,\" he replied briefly, or very\nbriefly. In 1952, Aneurin Bevan recalled\nhow the \"semi-ecclesiastical ritual\" of the\nHouse of Commons, with its \"soft-footed\nattendants\", had dampened his ardour\nwhen he first arrived there, fierily, from the\nRhondda.\nWhat did Mr Grant expect? \"I\nexpect,\" said Mr Grant, who\nwas not fooling, \"absolute rac-\nism and hostility from the To-\nries and Alliance. But that would be their\nproblem, not mine. I am only concerned\nwith the Labour party.\" (Here, Mr Grant\nadded that Joe Ashton, the \"right-wing\"\nLabour MP for Bassetlaw, has written to\ntell him that he supports the setting up of a\nblack parliamentary caucus.)\n\"To the Parliamentary Labour Party, we\nwould make one thing absolutely clear: we\nhave special interests to represent, and we\nwill be raising issues which affect black\npeople only.\" What issues? \"Racism, and\nracial disadvantage,\" he answered.\nAre you not yourself sick of this preoccu-\npation? \"No. To me it is a way of life. I only\nhave to go out of London to realise the rac-\nism of this country.\" (\"We went to a cot-\ntage in Wales,\" Councillor Lawrence inter-\nposed, \"and this little girl screamed and\ndropped her bag when she saw Bernie.\")\n\"The most important part of getting into\nParliament,\" Mr Grant went on, \"is black\nself-respect,\" or what he also called \"the\nwhole thing of image\". What do you mean?\n\"Young blacks need somebody they can\nlook up to as a black.\" \"They're thirsting\nfor a figure-head,\" Councillor Lawrence\nadded. \"Racists know that too,\" said Mr\nGrant, in his wheelchair at the table, \"that's\nwhy they don't want us to get there.\"\nMr Grant has inherited a 9,000-plus La-\nbour majority in Tottenham, though, like\nthe Labour party itself, he has the required\nskills to lose it.\nAnd after Labour's third defeat, I asked\nhim, won't there be party recriminations,\nincluding against the black sections activ-\nists? \"There'll be heavy recriminations,\"\nMr Grant answered bravely, and to his\ncredit. \"That's why we asked the others to\ncool it.\"\na\nti\nfc\nU\nth\nal\nsl\nCARO\n$1\nN\nd\nSAUCHAD\ntl\na\nI\nS\nt\nI\nh\nbi\np\ntu\nla\npl\nga\nd\ntc\nC\nP\n0\nr",

It will see the\n\"illegal\" launch of a black\nsection in the Birmingham\nLabour Party.\nLabour's National Exec-\nutive Committee ruled re-\ncently that there was no need\nfor a separate section in the\nparty for black people and\nadded that party members\nfaced expulsion if they became\ninvolved.\nThe Birmingham rally is\nbelieved to be the first of\nseveral to be held nationwide\nto set up black sections in\ntowns and cities.\nMr Neil Kinnock is being\nurged strongly by Labour MPs\nto intervene by publicly\nrepudiating those involved\nand warning of the dangers to\nparty unity.\nThe proposal by Mr Grant\nand Miss Bellos to visit Bir-\nmingham has infuriated most\nof the city's Labour MPs and\nfive of them, headed by Mr\nHattersley, have written in the\nstrongest terms to the two\ncouncil leaders.\n-\nto\nIn their letter the five - Mr\nDenis Howell, Mr Jeff\nRooker, Mr Terry Davis, Mr\nRobin Corbett, and Mr\nrefer\nHattersley\ntomorrow's rally as \"a meet-\ning organized by a small,\nunrepresentative group of\npeople who claim to be con-\ncerned about the problems of\nsome ethnic communities\nwithin our city\".\nThey add: \"As Labour MPs\nin Birmingham, fully commit-\nted to racial equality and\nending\ndiscrimination,\nwe\nwant to make it clear that\nneither Birmingham District\nLabour Party nor the city\ncouncil needs any advice from\nyou or Haringey and Lambeth\ncouncils.\n\"Indeed, we would have\nthought that you had more\nthan enough to do in your own\narea in countering the ravages\nof Conservative cuts in the\nmoney which can be spent by\ncouncils on the vital services\non which so many people need\nto rely.\n\"But if you do have spare\ntime, you should come to\nBirmingham to learn how a\nsensible and progressive coun-\ncil the largest Labour-led\ncouncil in Britain - is dealing\nwith this problem instead of\ncoming to give us the doubtful\nbenefit of your advice.\"\nThe Birmingham Labour\nMPs say in a press release on\nthe two council leaders' visit:\n\"We don't want you\".\nMr Simon Hinds, a spokes-\nman for Birmingham black\nsections, said that the decision\nto hold a rally had not been\ntaken to defy Labour's NEC\ndeliberately.\n\"We believe encouraging\nblack people to get involved in\nthis society's political struc-\ntures is more important than\ntaking note of dictatorial and\nundemocratic rulings created\nwithout black people's\nconsent.\n\"The black section is here to\nensure a vital need for the\nblack community to get in-\nvolved in politics.

            "COVER STORY\nThe chances of blacks\nof blacks as MPs\nBritain's black community has come a long way in emerging as a political force. Now, in this election,\nwe are likely to see some black candidates become Members of Parliament. Joel Kibazo examines the\npossibilities.\nThe\nhe British general election of 11 June\npromises to be different not only for\nthe reasons given here but also because it is\nthe first election in which we are likely to\nsee a number of black candidates in\nParliament.\nIt is important to note that the term\n'black' means different things in different\nsocieties. In Britain it means, more or less,\nanyone who is not white (often, this may\neven include Chinese and Arabs) but in\nthe main it refers to people of Afro-\nCaribbean backgrounds or Asians from\nthe Indian sub-continent, thus singling out\nthe two main groups which immigrated to\nBritain in the 1950s and 60s. For the pur-\nposes of this article the term 'black' shall\nrefer to people of African or Caribbean\ndescent.\nThe ruling Conservative party is fielding\nJohn Taylor, a 32-year-old barrister born\nand bred in Birmingham, whose father\nwas a well-known cricketer. The Social\nDemocrat and Liberal parties, known\ntogether as the Alliance, do not have any\nblack candidates. The main socialist oppo-\nsition, the Labour Party, leads the way with\nsix black candidates.\nThese are: Diane Abbott, Paul Boateng,\nBernie Grant, Russell Proffitt, Ben Bous-\nque and Crispin St Hill. With the excep-\ntion of Mr St Hill, the other candidates are\nstanding in London constituencies, with\nlarge black populations.\nThe first three candidates are almost cer-\ntain to be elected as they are standing for\nseats with big Labour majorities. Mr\nRussell Proffitt is standing for a seat which\nis held by the Conservatives, but with only\na small majority of less than 2,000, so he\nstands an outside chance of making it to\nthe House of Commons.\n-\nThe election of three or possibly four\nblacks to the House of Commons will be a\nremarkable achievement and yet logic\ndictates that it should not be seen as anyth-\ning remarkable. When you consider that\nblack people have been in the British Isles\nfor more than 200 years through slavery.\ncolonialism, as immigrant workers or as\nstudents, many would argue that it is high\ntime that the House of Commons lost its\naura of \"an all white, male-dominated\nmiddle class club.\"\nComparisons with the political situation\nin the USA, where there are black Con-\ngressmen and Senators, are unfair and at\nbest misleading. In the UK, blacks make\nup at least three per cent of the overall pop-\n10\nEMPIRE\nWINDRUSH\nLONDON\nAfro-Caribbean immigrants arrive in England just after the last World War on the Empire\nWindrush\nulation. In the USA the figure is 15 per\ncent; but in the UK, the black population is\nconcentrated in the inner city areas of Lon-\ndon. Birmingham, Manchester. Liverpool\nand Bristol. If life was fair, then this con-\ncentration should have led to the election\nof black Members of Parliament long\nago.\nThe reasons why this is not so are many\nand varied, but briefly, when immigrants\narrived in the UK, many came to a society\nwhere the environment, way of life and\ncustoms were in many ways different from\ntheir own.

In her 1987\nbook Black People and Party Politics in Bri-\ntain. Marian Fitzgerald stated that the\nsame government which invited blacks to\nwork in the 'mother country' now passed\n\"successively more stringent measures to\nensure that people like themselves would\nas far as legally possible, not again be\nallowed to settle in this country; measures\nwhich surrounded family reunions with\nthe bitter taste of bureaucratic suspicion\nand downright hostility.\"\nGradually though, as the blacks became\nmore settled and more sure of their way in\nBritish life. they started to become more\ninvolved in political life. First it was\nthrough organisations of their own, such\nas anti-racist and anti-colonial groups.\nIn the 1970 general election David Pitt.\nnow Lord Pitt, a medical doctor from the\nWest Indies, stood for the safe Labour seat\nof Battersea and saw a safe Labour majority\ndisappear in an 18 per cent swing to the\nConservatives.

But Labour had yet to realise\nthat if blacks voted for them they had to be\nseen as being promoted through party\nranks.\nThe right wing press and those to the\nright of the political spectrum once again\nlampooned the demands of Black Sections\nas another form of left wing extremism.\nFaced with opinion polls showing that\nBLACK\nSECTION\nNO WITCH HUNT\nAGAINST THE\nbe working within the confines of the\nLabour Party rules and would be working\nfor a Labour victory at the next election.\nWhat happens after the next election is\nanybody's guess.\nWhat is interesting, though, is the gain-\ning of power at local government level.

Russell Proffitt stood in the 1979\ngeneral election and received a respectable\n25 per cent of the vote in the City of Lon-\ndon and Westminster constituency. Paul\nBoateng stood for Hertfordshire but, as\nwith his two predecessors, was not elected.\nHis situation was not helped by the local\nLabour Party in his constituency failing to\ncampaign for him actively because they\nsaw him as a candidate of the Labour party\nnationally. \"At least that was the official\nreason they gave for not supporting him,\"\none observer said.\nIt was also in 1983 that the Black Sec-\ntions grouping within the Labour Party\nfirst emerged at the Labour Party con-\nference. Within the party the group's main\nbody of support is from the far left. The\nargument advanced by Black Sections is\nthat for years the Labour Party has been\nhappy to receive the vote of the black peo-\nple but do nothing to address the issues of\nparticular concern to them such as racism\nin housing, education, immigration and\nthe general advancement of blacks in Bri-\ntain as equal members of society.\nThey wanted affiliation to the party in\nthe same way that women and Jewish peo-\nple have official affiliation to the party.\nTwice the group sought affiliation and\ntwice it was rejected.\nNeil Kinnock gave the group publicity in\n1985 when he entered the debate and he\nhas maintained consistently that there is\nno room in the Labour Party for a grouping\nbased on a person's colour. But Labour did\nset up a working party to study the issue\nand while it accepted the claims made by\nBlack Sections, it chose instead to set up its\nown body - the Black and Asian Advisory\nCommittee. This lacked the support of\nmany blacks and is now defunct.\nYet Black Sections have continued to\nwage a public campaign.

Sixty eight per cent of Black people compared to 31 per\ncent of white people in Britain live in the metropolitan\ncounties. * People of African and Asian descent were brought here\nto do the dirty, low-paid jobs. They were cramped into squalid\nhousing in the ghetto conditions\nof the inner cities. When jobs\nbecame less plentiful, Black people were harassed by hostile\nofficials and the police as Conservative and Labour governments\npandered to racists by turning the screw of immigration laws. An\nanalysis of Department of Employment figures shows that 32 per\ncent of 16 to 24 year old Black men are out of work compared to 18\nper cent of white men in the same age group.\nare\nThe education system has failed Black children. In the past it\nconsigned \"West Indian\" pupils to the dustbin of schools for the\neducationally sub-normal. Bengali children\nnow being\ndisadvantaged to become the new \"under-achievers\". Racist attacks\nhave gone unpunished while,\nin contrast, Black people have been\ncrime and\nscape-goated for\npursued by special police squads.\nDiscrimination at work has been sometimes perpetrated by employer\nand union official alike.\nIt is against this background that Black people have organised\nthemselves to fight-back and survive. This resistance has taken\nthe form of protest groups, self-defence campaigns and self-help\nvoluntary organisations. Youth, totally alienated by the racism\nthey face in the system, have rebelled through uprisings.\nElectoral action has so often seemed a fruitless exercise when the\na main political parties' unwritten concensus\non race has led many\nBlack people to feel they must\nchoose between different evils at\nthe polls.\nintent\nwod\nthird\nNow the Margaret Thatcher wants to clinch top honours by putting\nthe boot in more ruthlessly than any previous government. She\nposted her\nin 1987, after the Tory party's\nconsecutive General Election win, by saying she planned to pay\n\"special attention\" to the inner cities. Her proposals do not\ninclude the huge injection of cash for regeneration which is\nnecessary to arrest the massive decay and despondency brought\nabout by her government's destruction of manufacturing industries.\nThat is clear from the glossy but totally empty \"Action for\nCities\" package launched this month.\nAll Thatcher proposes is a screen of cosmetic initiatives behind\nwhich big business and law enforcement agencies will get to work\non the real project of bringing the inner cities to heel. That\nmeans more attacks on local democracy because Labour authorities\nin these areas have progressive policies. And more strong-arm\ntactics against Black people\nthe Tories cast in the role of\nbullies sending in coercive police instead of launching a crusade\nagainst racism.",
            "2.\nMuch more significant than\nAction\nfor Cities is the package of\ndivisive new laws including the one bringing in the Community Charge\nor poll tax. A recent study says ninety two per cent of Black\nhouseholds in inner London will be worse off, with an average loss\nto them of €759 a year if this deeply unpopular measure is\nintroduced.\nRate-capping has had a\ndisasterous effect on the ability of\nprogressive councils in the\ninner cities to provide a safety-net\nthrough the funding of Black voluntary groups. Vital services to the\nBlack elderly, unemployed and youth have been axed. Now even the\n\"creative accounting\", which allowed some of the councils to lessen\nthe impact of rate-capping, has been banned. tedy od\nvod\nThe Runnymede Trust's latest report notes that much of the \"positive\naction\" taken by local councils - denounced as \"loony left\" - were\nincluded in a green paper 10 years ago which was considered a modest\nand constructive document.

The Tory tactic of control,\nthrough the development of a small Black elite, and containment,\nthrough oppressive law-enforcement, will blow up in their face.\nThere is still time for the government to turn back from the current\ndisasterous course. They could drop their objection to contracts\ncompliance and begin compelling\nemployers in the inner cities to\nhire Black workers in proportion\nto our numbers in the population.\nResearch has shown that American companies subject to contracts\ncompliance increased their Black work-force by 20 per cent compared\nto 12 per cent in other companies.

            "THE COMMUNITY CHARGE\nUpto 1987, the main weapon used by government was the system of taxation\nand the distribution of government revenue. The emphasis has shifted\nfrom direct to indirect taxation, followed by reductions in public.\nspending, rate capping and the current proposals for the poll tax - all\nhave broken the relationship with the ability to pay. To give just one\nexample, local authorities in inner cities have lost over t2 billion in\nrate support grant, with some such as the abolished GLC and the to-be-\nabolished ILEA receiving no money from the taxes. The poll tax\nproposals come as a logical follow-up to the increasing pressures of\nValue Added Tax. no dos\nThe poll-tax which is emphatically called Personal Community Charge\n(PPC) is set by the local authority at the beginning of each financial\nJa year.\nyear. The only people exempted from paying will be:\nad 1. The 18 year olds still at school for whom child benefit are paid\n2. Convicted (not on remand) prisoners\n3.\nPeople with severe mental disabilities\nUnemployed people receiving housing benefit and students will be\nnew liable to pay 20% of the poll tax. ea\nand\nJuo The second method of collecting the poll tax will be the Collective\nCommunity Charge (CCC). This applies to some houses with multiple\ndug occupation and shared flats, for example, where there are many adults.\nliving together in households. In this case, the landlord will be given\nthe responsibility of collecting or recouping the costs of the charge\nbeats from the residents through collective community charge contributions.\nThe individual contribution will be calculated on a daily basis and\ncharged with any rent that is paid.\nJoe A third charge will be the standard community charge which is levied on\nsecond homes, holiday lets etc., at a rate higher than the PPC.\nat\nI\nIf arrears\nevery case, the poll tax is not related to ability to pay.\nbuild up, a 30% or £50 surcharge as interest will be imposed after 3\nmonths.\nREGISTRATION\nEach local authority area will have a poll tax register. This will\ncontain the names of the people whose \"sole or main residence\" are in\nthe area. The register will be a \"rolling register\" which means it will\nbe constantly updated - unlike the electoral register which is produced\nyearly. Every resident over 18 living in the area will have to\nregister. Certain \"responsible person\" will be nominated in each\nhousehold to ensure that everyone in the house is included in the\nregister. Failure to provide information properly is punishable by a\nfine of £50, rising to £200 for any further offences. Every source of\n-1-",
            "and\nmeans, no limit, apart from social services and police record will be\nused to compile information with which to produce the poll tax\nregistration. The registration will be the responsibility of the\nregistration officer (RO). Any evation of more than 20% will force\ncinner city residents who register for the poll tax to pay more (less in\naffluent areas) to enable a local authority to collect the same amount\nof revenue. In time the widespread non-registration will lead to the\nissuing of passes - apartheid-style.\nTHE EFFECTS OF THE COMMUNITY CHARGE ON BLACK PEOPLE\nThe poll tax will have the devastating effect on Black people or\nhouseholds. For instance about 90 - 94% of Black people live in inner\ncity areas, and most of these areas end up with the very highest poll\ntax bills. Unemployment is highest amongst Black people and as such,\nthey are in the lower income bracket. Above all, Black people in most\ncases, because of their lower income and finding accommodation\ndifficultly, tend to live in larger households. These people will be\nhit the hardest, since the poll is not related to the ability to pay.\nFor example, the average poll tax bill for a Black family household can\nbe as much as £800 or more compared to an average £400 for white\nhouseholds. There is no means of knowing or explaining how the rebate\nsystem help low income families.\nTHE EFFECTS OF COMMUNITY CHARGE ON THE LOCAL AUTHORITY\nThe change to the poll tax system would force local authorities to cut\nspending to meet the central government's demand in minimum spending\nlevel, thus a further ratecapping on local authorities. This will put\nthe restraint on the council to force cuts in services and lower\nstandards to the detriment of those in need. Since, any expenditure\nwould have to be financed through the PCC, any increase cannot be raised\nthrough the National Non-Domestic Rate (NNDR) as before.\nIt is difficult to assert how the system would affect each or different\nwards but there are strong indications and evidence that it will affect\neverybody and the number of losers will far out number those that will\ngain by it. For instance, 17% only pay more in some affluent areas\nwhile over 96% of households in the inner cities will be worse off. In\neffect, the poll tax system will mean bigger bills for the poorest,\nmainly Black families who are already bearing the brunt of inner city\ndeprivations and smaller bills for the rich.\nThe transformation of the poll tax system is extended to 1990 so that\ntraumas of the transition could be absorbed gradually.\nmeasures of harshness and the severity with which the poll tax system is\nanticipated.\nThe long term impact of the poll tax will be the migration labour from\nareas with a high taxation to those areas with the lower tax, thus\nemptying many inner-city areas and breaking-up families and communities.\nThose unable to move, will live in areas of decline, creating a\n2 -",
            "\"docklands-type\" situation which the Tory government can exploit by\nturning these areas into playground of the rich over the comming thirty\nyears or so.\nTHE VOLUNTARY SECTOR: WHOSE AUTONOMY?\nThe voluntary sector, local groups/organisations that have already.\nobtained charitable status or are seeking such status, play a very\nimportant role in society. Tory government and Labour local authorities\nhave supported such organisations with opposing ideologies.\nThe voluntary sector often acts as a mediator between the people and the\nays ruling class establishment. Under-resourced and strained voluntary\norganisations are filling the gaps in the social and welfare services\ni. e. providing a service for the community.\nThe constant revision of the criteria for grant applications has also\nmade it very difficult for the voluntary sector to develop whilst the\nen demands that are being made by the general public increase and the need\nfor voluntary groups to participate more closely with local authorities.\nso as to keep an eye on them has become more intense.\nT\nbas\nhist\nAmongst the various different pressures facing the voluntary sector a\nnew threat has just recently risen it's head to threaten the autonomy\nand accountability of all voluntary groups and especially Black groups.\nThere are hundreds of such cases one is described in detail below.\nRecently the Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd and his underling John Patten.\nbegan a clinical and co-ordinated campaign to get dismissed from post a\nyoung Black activist who was working for a recently formed development\nagency in St. Pauls Bristol, scene of the very first disturbances in the\n1980's and most recently a drugs raid called Operation Delivery in 1986.\nKuomba Balogun had been employed by the St. Pauls Local Development\nAgency in March of this year with the comprehensive task of co-\nordinating the response of Black voluntary organisation to the various\nschemes and other proposed actions of the present government and a lot.\nmore beside.\nHis crime in the government's eyes was that he had a criminal record,\nhis opposition to the use of a community centre built 3 years after the\nHis out spokeness\n1980 disturbances because of it's lack of facilities.\non issues of racism and police brutality and a host of other issues\nwhich were affecting Black people.\nDouglas Hurd and John Patten with other MP's called for his dismissal\nclaiming Kuomba was unfit to head the agency and publicly requested that\nBS 1000, the sponsoring body should dismiss him or jeopardise 70 LDAs up\nand down the country.\n- 3 -",
            "This was resisted passionately by the National Fund that paid the grant\nto Bristol for as long as it possibly could. The government pressured\nBS 1000 long and hard and when that was not successful enough, underling\nJohn Patten introduced new rules that was to come into immediate effect\nso as to dismiss Kuomba from his post setting a very serious precedent\nfor every other voluntary organisation nationally.\nbeen\nEMPLOYMENT\nThe government has sought to create a smoke screen in order to counter\nsome of the criticisms that it has faced. The \"Enterprise Culture\"\nwhich was implemented in the United States in the sixties has been\nadopted lock, stock and barrel by the government. One of the mainstays\nof this enterprise culture is the establishment of schemes by liberal-\nminded businesses - usually under the glare of television spotlights\nfor the unemployed to work for benefits or to live in poverty.\nyouth in Britain have rejected this and are opting out daily and are\nsuffering incredible hardship or hustling for a living. Far from\nimproving the conditions, these measures are exacerbating the problems\nthey seek to solve.\nBlack\nSPECIAL EMPLOYMENT MEASURES (SEM)\nTask forces are the most notable manifestation of SEMS so far. They\nhave been put into 16 areas up and down the country and seek to work\ndirectly with the community. In fact they have generally ignored the\nneeds of the Black community and created a lot of tensions within those\ncommunities. The most sinister aspect of task forces is that they are\nlinking up a number of agencies that relate to crime prevention and\ninformation gathering. The Black Caucus have organised a series of\nmeetings around task forces and are soon to publish their findings.\nBlack community must develop an organised response to these measures and\nthe Black Caucus are facilitating these responses.\nIt is crucial for us that we begin to develop strategies that allow us\nat the moment to monitor the situation. We believe there is a\nfundamental flow in the overall strategy in promoting enterprise culture\nas a major means of employment generation and we are certain that the\nmeasures that have been adopted are harmful to the welfare of the Black\ncommunity. For example the Enterprise Allowance shceme has meant that\nBlack people attempting to start businesses in a depressed economy with\na lack of develoment capital and a dearth of support services to help\nwith marketing accounting and management. In short they are bound to\nfail. Yet job centres and employment agencies are steering unemployed\nBlacks in droves to start these businesses. It is notable that the £40\na week allowance on\non the scheme is a lot less than most people are\neligible for under social security.\n4 -",

INTRODUCTION\nMost members of Britain's Black communities\nare disgusted, if not totally disenchanted,\nwith the general political process of\nthis country, and in particular that part\nof it under the influence and control of\nthe Labour Party.\nOur sufferings, be they at the hands of\nracists on the streets or in institutions\nof the state, such as the Police or schools,\nOur needs and\nare well enough known.\ndemands for equality, for justice and for\nYet\nrepresentation are patently obvious.\n5 their realisation - despite promises\nalways seems a distance away.\nead\n-\nTo many of us, as Socialists, such a situat-\nion is not only totally intolerable but\nprovides a prime reason why we now feel\nit essential that radical changes are\nmade, so that a new, determined and more\nstrategic way of operating in British politcal\naffairs is created.\nWe take the view that, as far as the Labour\nParty is concerned, the time is right for\nthe creation of means through which Black\npeople in the Party could come together\ncreate the ground on which the on-going\nbattle against racism in society, and in\nthe Party, can be based. This, we feel,\ncould best be done through the creation of\nBLACK SECTIONS.\n2.\nQ: SURELY BLACK SECTIONS WOULD BE A\nREGRESSIVE MOVE?\nA: We are well aware that some see the call\nfor Black Sections as regressive. \"Black\npeople already\" they say \"play their full\n\"Gradual progress\"\npart in my constituency\".\nthey say \"is already being made\".\n,",
            "-2-\n(Neil Kinnock says: \"There will be six or\nBlack M.P.'s in Parliament next\nseven\nround\"\n-\ntime\nas if that is the be all and end\nall of the changes required.)\nIn response, three things at least need to be\nsaid. First, it is by no means necessarily\ntrue that those people 'making progress' (!)\nare 'representative' of Black people\nalthough frankly, that is the way such\nindividuals are often presented.\n-\nSecondly, and much more fundamentally,\nan overall structure to 'representation;\nthere is little chance of the overall strategic\nchanges that are desired, ever taking place.\nIn other words, the old colonial strategies\nof 'divide and rule' are likely to continue\nif change, geared towards greater Black.\ninvolvement in Labour's affairs, isn't achieved.\nThirdly, use of such terms as 'regressive' and\ngradual' display that disturbing paternalistic\ntone, (some say racist) used by so many in the\nLabour Party when looking at the struggle for\nracial equality. In other words, they gloss.\nover the demands of Black people for full and\ndirect participation NOW as a non-negotiable.\nright, as no more than some\naaberration!\n3.\nunrealistic\nQ: WHY ARE EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS INADEQUATE?\nA: Let us first make clear we do not deny the\nintegrity of a handful of Labour Party activists\nwho have worked conscientiously for racial\nequality. But the Party as a whole has\nconsistently failed to deliver positive policies\nto combat the racial inequalities in housing,\nemployment, education and public services.\nNeither has the Party got a credible record\non immigration laws and nationality.\nsymptomatic of the fact that the Party\nThis is\n10\n-3-\nHeadquarters has, over the years, neglected\nto hear an organised voice from the Black\ncommunity either in its policy groups or on\nthe National Executive Committee (NEC). For\nin the\nwhilst some Black representation occurs\nParty, there is no systematic guarantee that\nour views will be heard at all levels of the\nParty hierarchy - i.e. at Parliamentary Labour\nParty, NEC, Executive Committee, Local\nGovernment Committee or General Management\nCommittee levels.\n4.\n-\nQ: WOULDN'T BLACK SECTIONS BE 'DIVISIVE'\nTHEY BREACH THE PRINCIPLE OF TOGETHERNESS\nIN THE STRUGGLE' ?\nA: The Labour Party since its foundation has\nalways been a federal structure composed of\ninterest groups, regional blocs, local campaign\nYgroups and single issue groups. Each group has\nbeen bound to the other by the common thread\nof Socialism. Sometimes, it is beneficial in\nour struggle, to examine the superficiality of\nthe concept of 'togetherness' when, as Black\nactivists, we feel it is the difference between\nus and the rest of the Labour movement which\nneeds to be better understood. This is because\nso many other people often use such differences\nIgas the basis for kicking us to the bottom of\nthe pile. In other words, we must move away\nfrom the 'colour blind' approach because it\nmerely masks a whole series of issues which\nmust be explored if racial equality is to be\ncreated.\n[imago Insmevom woods ads ni\nIt is absurd to characterise the efforts of those\nof us who are seeking to develop ways of\nchallenging the complacency of the Party on\nrace as 'divisive'. After all, it is the\nweakness of existing approaches and the\nblatantly unprincipled compromise to racist\nsentiments by the Party of old over such\nmatters as immigration and nationality which",
            "-4-\nhas resulted in the present crisis of confidence\nwhich has spawned Black Sections. If anything,\nis divisive at the moment, it is the white,\nmiddle-class male dominance of the Party\nleadership. They seem hell-bent on preventing\nus getting any closer to equal representation\nand power-sharing. Yet they should not feel\nthreatened. By supporting the establishment\nof an organised Black voice in the Labour\nParty they will help strengthen Labour's\npolitical appeal, for we believe that unless\nconcrete changes are made, come election time,\nin key marginals (and there are at least 37 of\nthem) where the Black vote could make a\nsignificant difference, abstentions could well\nbecome the order of the day. Such a situation\nwould deny Labour the victory we all wish to see.\nng 5.\nQ: BY EMPHASIZING RACE - AND NOT CLASS\n-\nSURELY\nBLACK SECTIONS ARE OFFENSIVE TO THE TRADITIONS'\nAND 'SPIRIT OF THE MOVEMENT'?\nA: Challenging the 'traditions' and 'spirit' of\nthe movement ought not to be seen as 'offensive'.\nThe reality of the 'spirit of the movement' is\nthat it often seems to be embodied in male,\nes middle-class, white representatives and it is\nthis which is deeply offensive - to Black people\nand to women - and frankly must change.\nThis tradition has nothing to do with arguments\nabout 'merit', but everything to do with\nhistoric patterns of privelege - the very thing\nwe in the Labour movement constantly say we\nagainst but do so little to change.\nare\nIn any event, the attempt to draw attention to\nthe reality of racism and the need for action\nto put matters right, ought not to be seen as\ndetracting or minimising in any way the critical\nimportance of class to an understanding of the\nforce at play in society.\nba\n-5-\nIt is merely an attempt to highlight yet\nanother significant dynamic which must be\ntaken account of in the struggle for social\njustice.\n6.\nQ: HOW WOULD BLACK SECTIONS FIT INTO THE\nSTRUCTURE OF THE PARTY?\nA: Black Sections, as with Women's Sections\nwould be an integral part of a local Party\nwith, as at present, full participation of\nits members at every level of constituency\naffairs, but would also create space in which\nthe dimension of race can be more fully\ndiscussed, and not ignored as so often\nhappens in most Parties at present.\nArrangements would be made for the Constituency\nBlack Section to be represented regionally,\n(on the Regional Executive) and nationally\n(on the National Executive Committee) within\nthe Party.\n7.\nQ: MUST ALL BLACK PEOPLE JOIN THE BLACK SECTION?\nA: No. We take the view, aware obviously of\nsome of the problems involved that, as with\nwomen and their struggle against sexism in the\nParty, Black members of the Party, where it is\ndesired, ought to be able to establish Black\nbe abl\nSections, so that frank and full discussion\ncan take place and proper programmes of action\ndevised. These will then be taken to the\nParty for further discussion and implementation.\n8.\nQ: WOULDN'T BLACK SECTIONS PUSH BLACK PEOPLE BACK\nINTO 'GHETTOES' AS WELL AS ENABLING WHITE\nPEOPLE TO AVOID FACING UP TO THEIR\nRESPONSIBILITIES FOR FIGHTING AGAINST RACISM?\nA: No. Let us be clear, we are not talking\nabout creating cul-de-sacs or 'ghettoes'.\nWhat we\nare talking about is building a clear\navenue for free expression of thought, which",
            "-6-\nat the moment\nwould be channelled back into the Party.\nthrough continued involvement as\nIn\nthis way, we believe real momentum, and direct\nexperience can be added to what, at present,\nis a slow and depressing debate taking\neveryone nowhere.\nWe realise of course that there can never be\na direct correlation between the birth of an\nBut what cannot\nidea and its implementation.\nbe denied is that in what we are proposing at\nleast the idea has a chance of being born\ndirectly out of experience of those at a\ndisadvantage, untainted by guilt-ridden\npatrimony of those already on a position of\nsome advantage.\nThrough the creation of Black Sections we\nbelieve that Labour will not only have created\nfor itself a way of enabling the real causes\nof racism to be aired and understood, but,\nmore importantly, a means through which those\nwho bear its heaviest brunt could, at least,\nHOT play a\nplay a direct role in its eradication\n-\n-\na\nrole so long overdue particularly in inner\ncity areas where Labour relies so heavily on\nthe Black vote but does so little to deserve it.\n9.\nQ: HOW IS 'BLACK' DEFINED?\nIt is used\nA: \"Black\" is a political concept.\nto include all racially oppressed minorities.\nEach geographical area, therefore, is likely\nto reflect its own 'Black' communities.\nmost areas, this will inevitably mean people\nHowever,\nof Afro-Caribbean or Asian descent.\nin Haringey, for example, Cypriots have\nchosen to be, and are, involved in Black\nSections.\nIn\n10\n-7-\nQ: WHAT EXACTLY WOULD BLACK SECTIONS DO?\nA: This would vary depending on local\ncircumstances but a long-term programme for a\nConstituency Black Section could involve such\nmatters as:\nmonitoring the performance of\nthe Party and its representatives\non race-related matters;B\norganising campaigns on:\nEDUCATION\nEMPLOYMENT\nANTI DEPORTATION\nMEMBERSHIP OF THE LABOUR PARTY\nGETTING BLACK PEOPLE ON THE\nLOCAL ELECTORAL REGISTER\nTHE WORK OF THE LOCAL COUNCIL\nPOLITICAL EDUCATION THROUGH\nINVITING SPEAKERS ON LOCAL,\nNATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL ISSUES.\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON BLACK SECTIONS,\nCONTACT: The Secretary,\nLabour Party Black\nSections Steering Committee,\n39, Chippenham Road,\nLondon W.9.",

But it is very rare for these reports to explain\nwhat the Black Section stands for.\nThe Labour Party Black Section was formed six years ago (and the Birmingham\nbranch was formed three years ago) for two main reasons. First, to get a\nbetter representation of Black people in the Labour Party and in British\npolitical institutions generally. Although the overwhelming majority of Black\npeople (Afro-Caribbean and Asian) vote Labour, there are very few Black people\nin high positions in the Party or elected as Councillors or MPs. We believe\nthat it was necessary for Black people to organise in the Labour Party to\nchange this.\nThere is no doubt that we have been succesful so far. For the first time ever,\nfour Black MPs were elected at the last general election. And wherever Black\nSections have organised, there has been an increase in the number of Black\nCouncillors elected. We believe that there should be at least FOUR Black MPs in\nthe West Midlands County to reflect the proportion of Black people living in\nthe County and at least THIRTY Black MPs in Britain as a whole.\nThe second reason for forming Black Sections is to pressurise for the Labour\nParty to adopt anti-racist policies and to make the Party campaign against\nracism. We are all familiar with the Labour Party saying some very good things\nagainst racism when out of power, but failing to deliver the goods when in\npower. In the Black Sections we believe that Black people should organise as\nBlack people both within the Labour Party and in their own community\norganisations outside the Labour Party to make sure that the Labour Party is an\nanti-racist party.\nThe Black Section does not believe in Black separatism. We believe that Black\npeople should be involved in all parts of the Labour Party - not just in Black\nSections. But we also believe that Black people should organise within the\nLabour Party to ensure that we are not ignored. We believe that events have\nproved us right wherever Black Sections have organised, more Black people\nhave joined the Labour Party.\nBirmingham Labour Party Black Section does not just write leaflets or hold\npublic meetings. We are campaigning on a number of issues including the Poll\nTax, solidarity with the struggle against apartheid in South Africa and for the\nrestoration of the Race Relations and Equal Opportunities Committee on the City\nCouncil. And of course we also campaign for a Labour victory in local and\nnational elections.\nIf you want to know more or want to join the Labour Party Black Section write\nto:\nBirmingham District Labour Party Black Section, c/o The Secretary,\n71, Woodfort Road, Hampstead, Great Barr B43 5QN",

            "BLACK SECTION CANDIDATES FOR THE NEC - 1986\nWe demand the immediate recognition of all the Black Sections\nestablished in Constituency Labour Parties around the country. The\nrecommendations of the NEC's special working group in favour of Black\nSections being set up where Black party members want them should be\nincorporated in the constitution. This means Black Section\nrepresentation at GMC, District Party, Regional party and national party\nlevels.\nThe party's national leadership has adopted a two-pronged attack on the\nsubstantial gains made by the Black Section campaign. The first prong\nhas been to set up the neo-colonialist \"Black and Asian advisory\ncommittee\". The second has been the expulsion from party membership of\ntwo leading Birmingham supporters Amir Khan and Kevin Scally. These\ntactics are well-known to us and have been perfected over many decades.\nof \"divide and rule\". We totally oppose the witch-hunting of Socialists\nfrom the Labour Party. Furthermore, we would refuse to serve on the\nBlack and Asian advisory committee or any other body aimed at Black\npeople but not elected by and accountable to them.\nWe are committed to furthering the Black Section's anti-imperialist\nintervention in politics. This means stepping up the fight for Black\nnational liberation in Azania (South Africa), support for the demands of\nthe Palestinians and support for British withdrawal from Ireland.\nBritain must withdraw from NATO. The grip on developing countries of\nneo-colonialism and big business has to be broken. The Labour Party must.\nreplace its patronising approach to international aid and development\nwith policies relevant to Black people at home and abroad. But the most\nurgent priority is to isolate racist South Africa. We restate the Black\nSection's demands for:\n1. Immediate disinvestment by unions and Labour authorities%;B\n2. A national Labour Party fund to provide aid for Azania's freedom\nfighters supported by a national publicity campaign spearheaded by the\ntrade union and Labour Party%;B\n3. An officially-backed refusal by trade unionists to handle South\nAfrican goods;\n4. The unconditional release of all South African political prisoners;\n5. A manifesto commitment that a Labour Government will break off\ndiplomatic relations with Pretoria's racist regime and rescind rights to\nresidency in Britain of the one million White South Africans who\ncurrently have this entitlement.\nLabour must back up its anti-racist statements made in opposition with\nbold action in government.\nLabour's economic policies must be geared to full employment. Ownership\nby the workers of the commanding heights of British industry must be\nswiftly achieved. There must be a national minimum wage. Youth Training\nScheme slave wages must be ended. Trade union rights for all workers",
            "must be guaranteed. Positive policies aimed at ending racism - including\ncontracts compliance and employment equality targets - must be\nimplemented.\nThe health service workers - many of whom are low paid and Black - must\nbe properly valued and rewarded. The NHS should be adequately resourced.\nEducation for all means a crusade against racist stereo-typing by the\nBritish school system. The culture, achievements and history of Black\npeople must be positively portrayed.\nRacist immigration laws must be repealed. The police must be freed of\nracist practices and placed under the democratic control of elected\nrepresentatives. We fully support Black Section policy on policing in\nthat the next Labour Government must:\n1.) Repeal the 1984 Police Act, the Public Order Act and the Prevention.\nof Terrorism Act;\n2. Enshrine in law the duty of the police to prosecute perpetrators of\nrace attacks;\n3. Set up a fully independent police complaints body;\n4. Ban the manufacture, stock-piling, and use of firearms, CS gas,\nplastic bullets, water cannon and other life-endangering equipment.\nBlack Section supporters on the NEC will be accountable to all\nConstituency Labour Parties and will communicate regularly with them.\nThere will be report backs and discussions with the Labour Party Black\nSection National Committee, its annual conference and duly elected\nofficers."

We intend to ensure that the magazine is used as a fo-\nrum for discussion within the Black communities. No issue will be too controversial for this magazine, nothing\naffecting the Black communities will be too \"hot\" or too \"cool\" for the magazine to handle.\nWhat Will The Black Parliamentarian Provide?\nWe intend to bring to you all those issues which are not covered by the national media, e.g., what are the Black\nMPs doing in Parliament? Well, we are asking questions of the Prime Minister and other Ministers but they are rarely\ncovered in the national media. We are taking part in Committees discussing laws like the Poll Tax, Immigration Acts,\nChildren's Bill, Finance Acts etc. We are making important speeches on issues like South Africa, Namibia and the\nway in which the Secret Service is being run. We are going abroad on Parliamentary and other visits to places as far\napart as Turkey and Trinidad and Tobago. We are meeting people from all over the globe, including such places as\nBelau in the Pacific and Alaska. We are discussing domestic issues such as Black Women, Immigration, the NHS,\nEducation, the Environment, the Budget, Racism, the Police, the Carnival, Adoption issues etc. We won't be serious\nall the time and we intend to let you know all the parliamentary gossip that \"serious\" newspapers don't print, like the\ntime the House of Commons Catering Department decided to \"go ethnic\" and put Ackee and Saltfish on the menu in\nthe Members' Cafeteria. It tasted lovely but had one fault! The price was £5 per portion whilst other meals were\naround £2. There were quite a lot of requests but the price put a lot of people off. I waited until they were forced to put\nthe price down to £1.50p before I ordered. Unfortunately, they have informed me that due to lack of orders they have\nbeen forced to remove it from the menu.\nWe intend to discuss all these issues with you in this and future editions. We intend to ensure that these very\nimportant issues are forced to the top of the agenda in Parliament and elsewhere. We also intend to circulate the maga-\nzine in the USA, where we have developed links with the Congressional Black Caucus. We want to contact Black\nCanadians, French people, Dutch people and other Black European Parliamentarians and others. This is particularly\nimportant because of the advent of 1992 and the Single European Market. We want to debate within our communi-\nties what 1992 holds for us. The article in this first issue by Ansel Wong, opens up a debate which we must have, if we\nare to survive in Europe after 1992. We are also needed to give assistance to our sisters and brothers in Europe who are\nnot covered by legislation in race relations to the extent that we are. We need to press for an amendment to the Euro-\npean Convention on Human Rights, so that the Convention recognises discrimination on grounds of race. We need to\npress for laws in Europe that recognise racial discrimination as an offence as British laws do. We need to fight for the\nrights of immigrants in Europe so that they may have the vote in the same way as Commonwealth citizens do in Brit-\nain, whilst making it clear to everyone that we are not in the same position as European immigrants because of our\nspecial relationship with Britain because of the Commonwealth.\nWe need to discuss the situation regarding the relationship between the EEC and the African, Caribbean and\nPacific countries. We need to press the EEC on what will happen to the banana trade with the Windward Islands,\nJamaica and Belize after 1992, and the Lome Convention. The situation in South Africa, Namibia and the Front Line\nstates is crucial to the status of Black people in the future.\nAre we to be called African-British or Asian-British as the Americans want to be called African-Americans?\nWhat is Jesse Jackson up to in Washington? Can Benazir Bhutto outmanoeuvre the fundamentalists in Pakistan? If\nyou know the answers maybe you can tell us. What about the death of Huey P Newton, one time Black revolutionary,\nand now shot dead in the street like a common hoodlum? The Black politicians and other Black people need to know\nyour opinions on these issues.\nWhat about Black businesses? How far are we prepared to go to support Black capitalism? Is there a difference\nbetween Black and White capitalists? What are our views on Islamic fundamentalism? Do we support Muslim\nschools? Is Salman Rushdie a blasphemer? All views need to be put so that we are as informed as possible.\nWe intend to print The Black Parliamentarian as often as possible and certainly not less than quarterly. We\nexpect that arising from the debates around some of the issues I have mentioned, we will go on to hold seminars and\ndiscussion groups around the topics. We want to take these debates around the country and reach some of the more\nremote Black communities that have been left out in the great debates that our communities have engaged in over the\npast few years.\nWe believe that such a magazine is urgently needed. We believe that the task of formulating coherent strategies\ncan no longer be left to chance and the CRE. We are entering unknown waters vis-a-vis the EEC and 1992. We are\nentering unchartered waters vis-a-vis an independent Namibia and a future liberated South Africa. We need such a\nmagazine as The Black Parliamentarian.

            "MUSIC\nTHE PARLIAMENTARY\nBLACK CAUCUS:\nThe Background\nЯАЧ\nVOICE\nBritain's Best Black Newspaper!\nSay it loud\nI'm Black\nand Proud\nIn June 1987, the first Black members of Parliament in modern times were elected to the British Par-\nliament. Diane Abbott, MP., represents Hackney North and Stoke Newington, Paul Boateng, MP., is\nin Brent South, Bernie Grant, MP., in Tottenham and Keith Vaz, MP., in Leicester East. Less than a\nyear after their triumph, three of those MPs, Abbott, Grant and Vaz, decided to form themselves into\na group The Parliamentary Black Caucus. Boateng hasn't joined the Caucus yet. Below is an out-\nline of the reasons why the PBC was set up and the aspirations its members have for it.\nThe election of the Black MPs has\nbeen hailed as a major step forward in the\nparticipation and representation of the\nBlack and minority ethnic communities\nin Britain. It has been welcomed not only\nby the communities themselves, but by\nmany individuals and institutions con-\ncerned with race relations - right across\nthe political spectrum. For the first time,\nBlack and minority ethnic communities\nare felt to have a voice at the level of na-\ntional Government in Britain.\nIn March 1988, the Parliamentary\nBlack Caucus was formed by three of the\nnew Black members of Parliament. In\nMay 1988, Lord Pitt of Hampstead also\njoined the Caucus. Although the existing\nCaucus members belong to the Labour\nParty, this is not to the exclusion of other\nparties.\nTHE NEED FOR A\nPARLIAMENTARY\nBLACK CAUCUS\nThe concept of a Black Caucus at the\nlevel of national Government is not a\nnew one. In the United States of Amer-\nica, the Congressional Black Caucus has\nexisted for nineteen years.\nEssentially, the Black Caucus pro-\nvides a forum in which Black representa-\ntives can meet together to discuss issues\nof common concern and to decide on\ncourses of action in relation to those con-\ncerns.\nThe need for such a Caucus in Britain\nderives from the fact that Black represen-\ntatives are in a minority and in a hostile\nenvironment which has never before had\nto confront the issues of race and race re-\nlations which the Caucus has a duty and\nan obligation to raise.\nThere is no other forum in which\nthese issues can be raised. Indeed, there\nare positive institutional obstacles to\nraising them in the Government and Par-\nliamentary system as it now stands.\nThe Parliamentary Black Caucus is\nnecessary too as a means of ensuring that\nwe develop our thinking as Black MPs.\nWe recognise that to allow ourselves to\nbe facing in different ways on the major\nissues affecting the Black and minority\nethnic communities would be to weaken\nour position substantially.\nThe PBC needs to exist on a formal\nand properly constituted basis, rather\nthan as an informal discussion group.\nThis is because we believe that the issues\nwhich we have to raise are far too impor-\ntant to be left to providence. Our lives as\nMPs are very busy and our task as Black\nrepresentatives is in addition to the jobs\nwe each have as constituency MPs. A\nstructured setting for our concerns is es-\nsential to ensure progress now and in the\nfuture.\nTHE ROLE OF\nTHE PARLIAMENTARY\nBLACK CAUCUS\nWe envisage that the role of the Par-\nliamentary Black Caucus will be essen-\ntially to raise issues of race and race rela-\ntions in Parliament and through other\nchannels open to Members of Parlia-\nment, for example, directly with Minis-\nters and Government institutions.\nThere are many issues which need to\nbe raised. Examples would be the posi-\ntion of Black and minority ethnic com-\nmunities within the inner cities in rela-\ntion to health care, employment, housing\nand social security. The areas of immi-\ngration policy and anti-discrimination\nlegislation are also key issues of major\nconcern. Perhaps the most pressing ques-\ntion is that of education and the future\nprospects of young people.\nThere are also important foreign af-\nfairs questions upon which we need to\ntake a stand. For example, the economic\nsituation facing Black and Third World\ncountries as a result of the growing debt\nburden. Another example is the situation\nwhich will face the Commonwealth\ncountries when the \"Single Europe\"\nagreement comes into force in 1992.\nOn all these matters, we shall seek to\nbe a focal point for the Black and minor-\nity ethnic communities to put their\nviews. We shall encourage individuals\nand organisations to bring their concerns\nto us, as indeed they have already begun\nto do. The approaches we have had indi-\ncate a strong desire for the Caucus to take\non this role.\nSo, it is in recognition of its national\nconstituency that the Parliamentary\nBlack Caucus has been formed. The\nBlack communities are well established\nin Britain and have great strength. But\nthey have waited a long time for political\nrepresentation at national level and have.\nThe Parliamentary\nmany demands.\nBlack Caucus aims to channel the\nstrength of the communities and to move\ntowards the meeting of these demands.\nThe Caucus was fortunate enough to\nreceive a small grant from Barrow Cad-\nbury Fund Limited, an non-charitable\nbenevolent company. The Grant has\nbeen given for a period of four years at\n£16,000 a year. It enables us to employ\nan administrator and to cover basic costs.\nwe hope to obtain additional funding\nfrom other sources in the future and to\nhold fundraising events.\n-4 The Black Parliamentarian\nThe Black Parliamentarian\n-5-",

But, I am not\ngoing to pretend that we as a move-\nment do not have a long way to go.\nBoth in terms of representation and of\npolicy, there is an enormous job still to\nNO TO\nSLAVE\nNO\nLABOUR TO\nTRIKI\nbe done. That requires careful\nthought and planning by Black people\nin the movement, but above all, it re-\nquires an open and willing response\nfrom the movement as a whole.\nAfter all, anti-racism means social\nand political change. That places a heavy\nburden on the institutions of the labour\nmovement. On the one hand, Black peo-\nple are looking to direct and lead the\nmovement, and on the other, they are\nrightly protesting at its own discrimina-\ntion and injustices.\nTake the whole issue of Black repre-\nsentation and organisation in the trade\nunions. The Transport and General\nWorkers' Union and others have identi-\n5\nSLAVE\nTOUR\nNOV\nTO\nSLAV\nLABOU\nfied a major change now taking place in\nthe UK economy: the division of our\nlabour market into a core workforce with\nrelatively good pay, conditions, and job\nsecurity, and the growing army of tempo-\nrary, casual, part-time and de-skilled\nworkers.\nThat's a matter of equal opportuni-\nties, because the majority of mar-\nginalised workers are women, and many\nare young and from ethnic minorities.\nAnd if you want to recruit, you have to\nrepresent. Black people will not join a\nunion or any other organisation that does\nnot give them a voice.\nAnd changing collective bargaining\nisn't easy either. How many deals and\nrecognition agreements include an equal\nopportunities clause? How much practi-\ncal trade union support is there for effec-\ntive ethnic monitoring?\nRacial harassment remains a fact of\nlife for many Black workers and overt ra-\ncism exists amongst trade unionists as\nACIST\nUNCILLORS III.\nBU CAN BUN!! BUT\nwell as employers. When Black workers You CAN\ncomplain to stewards or officials about\nsuch behaviour, action has got to be\ntaken. Rhetoric and pious expressions of\nconcern are not enough.\nIf anti-racism is about work for social\nand institutional change - then all sec-\ntions of the trade unions movement must\nbe involved. There are inspiring exam-\nples to be found, for example, of trade\nunion involvement in struggles against\ndeportations, but they are still too few.\nThe problem is not ideas for change\n- they are easy to find. Rather it is a\nquestion of the will to implement them.\nThere are clear questions of resources, of\npriorities and, frankly, of power.\nIf unions set up advisory committees,\nimprove the proportion of ethnic minor-\nity officers, and promote Black people\nthrough lay representative structures,\nthen power in the union will shift. And\nthat can be a difficult process. Some es-\ntablished interests may even find it a\nthreat. That is one reason why you will\nfind resistance in parts of even the most\nprogressive union to the notion that race\nequality is something we ought to be con-\ncerned about within our ranks.\nAnd that truth applies every bit as\nmuch to the Labour Party. That's why\nthe debate about Black representation\nhas been so hard-fought and so im-\nportant. I think there is, for example, a\nreal feeling of impatience that the pro-\nposal for a Black socialist society, which\nthe last Labour Party conference passed\nso clearly, is still being fought over at the\nParty's National Executive Committee.\nMy Union has played a constructive\nrole throughout that debate. And we cer-\ntainly hope that it will now be resolved in\na way that satisfies the terms of the Con-\nCan't\nHIDE\nAH WHO\nNEXT\nAWE\nTime to listen to women's needs\nference resolutions--and the hopes they\nclearly represent. We are certainly not\ngoing to sit idly by if an attempt is made\nto frustrate the Party's clear and demo-\ncratic will.\nBut the establishment of a working\nand successful society with proper repre-\nsentation at all levels of the Labour\nmovement - which I'm sure we are go-\ning to see-will only be one further step\non a long road.\nWe also have a job to do in making\nsure that anti-racist values permeate the\nParty's policy-making and campaigning.\nI was a member of the Party's Policy Re-\nview Group on Economic Equality. I\nwould certainly not criticise the final re-\nport, which I think is a constructive and\nuseful effort in a very complex and po-\ntentially expensive area. And I know that\neveryone involved in the Group made\n(Photo by Humphrey Nemar)\nevery effort to see that anti-racist con-\ncerns were fully considered in its work.\nBut that job was made more difficult, not\nby any failing on the part of the Group or\nits members, but because the organisa-\ntion of Black people within the Party is\nstill too weak.\nA Black socialist society could go a\nlong way to help with that problem. It\ncould rightly expect to be consulted and\ninvolved in a very wide range of policy\ndiscussions, from housing to the Na-\ntional Health Service, from education to\ncrime. And if, as my Union certainly\nhopes, we see a reform of the whole Party\npolicy-making system which makes it\nmore genuinely democratic and par-\nticipative, then Black people at every\nlevel of the Party will play their full part.\nThe Parliamentary Black Caucus has\nan important potential role as well. Of\ncourse, its members will rightly want\ntheir say on policy. Between them they\nhave an experience and an expertise\nwhich the Party badly needs. But they\nhave an even more important role. Par-\nliament remains an essential forum for\ndiscussion and debate. It is important.\nAnd it is vital - if Black people are to\nhave confidence in our democracy\nthat their voice is clearly heard. Already\nBlack MPs have made big steps in that\ndirection. They deserve our help and our\nsupport.\nThat may not always be comfortable\nfor established interests even in the\nlabour movement. But it is a political im-\nperative. On it, the success of Britain as a\ngenuinely tolerant and democratic soci-\nety may well turn.\nI am not a pessimist about the future\nof our movement. I wouldn't be an ac-\ntive trade unionist if I was. But I do think\nthat Black people at every level are mak-\ning a clear and distinct challenge to it.\nWill the labour movement listen to us?\nWill it accept the contribution we can\nmake? For the sake of our society, we\nmust make sure the answer is yes.\nFOR DETAILS OF\nHOW TO ADVERTISE IN\nTHE BLACK PARLIAMENTARIAN\nSEE PAGE 44.\n-6 The Black Parliamentarian\nThe Black Parliamentarian\n-7-",

The old political leadership\nis being eclipsed by the young militants\nwho, increasingly, are looking to main\nparty politics.\nUnder the Conservative government\nover the last ten years, the conditions for\nBlack people have worsened dramati-\ncally. The major features have been:\n* Record levels of unemployment\nfor Black people especially the young\n* More Black people are home-\nless or living in overcrowded condi-\ntions\n* Savage attacks on civil liberties\nand harsh sentencing by the courts\n* Racist immigration laws have\nsplit Black families\n* Refugees have had the door\nslammed in their face\nAnti-racist education has been\n**\nrubbished\n* The racist regime of South Af-\nrica has received huge political and\neconomic support\n* The poll-tax will have a devas-\ntating effect on Black people.\nYet the Labour Party and Trades Un-\nion movement have failed to come to\ngrips with the changing face of the work-\ning class.

Over the last twelve\nmonths, a high level group of the Par-\nty's powerful National Executive\nCommittee (NEC) has been in discus-\nsion with the unofficial organisation of\nBlack members called Labour Party\nBlack Section, (LPBS), and other in-\nterested groups to hammer out a pro-\nposal to be discussed at the Party's\nannual conference in October.\nThe draft proposal unveiled at the\nend of July says: \"The objective would\nbe to create an organisation affiliated to\nthe Party, be Black-led, provide for self-\nrepresentation of African, Caribbean and\nAsian members at all levels of the Party,\nand which has the full backing and sup- people world-wide.

Lord Cockfield (previously\nVice-President of the European Com-\nmission) set out in 1985 300 legislative\nmeasures (reduced to 279) necessary to\nachieve a single market. Most of these\nmeasures were concerned with the re-\nmoval of physical barriers (border con-\ntrols), fiscal barriers (VAT and excise\nduties) and technical barriers (trading\nstandards).\nEven though the 1957 Treaty of\nRome had specified the goal of a \"harmo-\nnious development of economic activi-\nties\", the impetus for this recent effort\nwas the recognition that the 12 separate\nstates were losing out to Japan and the\nUSA. The damaging effect on the econ-\nomy of each Member State and the rec-\nognition that an effective economic chal-\nlenge to the dominance of Japan and the\nUSA can only be mounted by a cohesive\ntrading bloc, is the rationale for the Sin-\ngle European market.\nby Ansel Wong\nThe priority then was economic co-\nhesion with social progress being seen as\na consequence of the \"liberation of the\nforces of growth\". It should not be sur-\nprising then that the social policy impli-\ncations of 1992 have not received as\nmuch attention as the economic meas-\nmuch attention as the economic meas-\nures. The social policy implications for\nmarginal groups are even further away\non the agenda. But before we examine\nthe implications of 1992 on a significant\nmarginal group - Ethnic Minorities -\nit is perhaps important to be aware of the\nsocial and political context under which\nEthnic Minority communities live in the\nEEC.\nMember states have statutory instru-\nments which offer protection to Ethnic\nMinorities against discrimination.\nWhile these guarantees of non-discrimi-\nnation are potentially an important\nnation are potentially an important\nsource of law, in practice they have been\nignored or abused. In Germany, the con-\nstitutional provision that prohibits dis-\ncrimination has been interpreted as a\ndeclaration of intent. In Denmark, per-\nsonal freedom and in Luxemburg, non-\ndiscrimination, are guaranteed only to\nnationals. In Italy, although the constitu-\ntion formally guarantees non-discrimi-\nnation, in practice the government itself\ndiscriminates both legislatively and ad-\nministratively.\nFew of the EC states have developed\na comprehensive system of civil reme-\ndies. In the Netherlands, while there are\nlaws that provide for compensation in the\ncase of certain types of discrimination,\nthese laws cannot form the basis of a pri-\nvate law suit: any legal action must be in-\nitiated by the public prosecutor. This is\ntrue of the laws prohibiting discrimina-\ntion in Belgium as well.\nThe Luxemburg law against racism\nof 1980 does not permit associations\ncombating racism to bring civil suits. In\nDenmark, there are no civil remedies\navailable to the injured minority; while\nin Greece, civil remedies are available to\ncitizens alone. And in Ireland, there is\nonly a single statute prohibiting dis-\ncrimination in dismissals from work that\nallows a private right of action. In the\nUnited Kingdom alone there is a system\nof laws that offers the minority legal pro-\ntection from discrimination both admin-\nistratively and by giving the individual a\nprivate right of action.\nWhile civil remedies in most of the\nEC states are relatively undeveloped in\nrespect to discrimination, a few of the\nstates have enacted special criminal laws\nto punish, rather than to compensate for,\nacts of discrimination. Denmark and the\nNetherlands have developed comprehen-\nsive systems of criminal law. Other\nstates, though offering minorities mini-\nmal protection in their criminal codes,\nhave been less conscientious.\nIreland has no special provisions in\nits criminal code to combat racism at all.\nThe Luxemburg law against racism of\n1980 has yet to be applied. A Greek law\npunishes incitement to racial violence or\nhatred with two years imprisonment.\nBelgian law forbids public incitement to\ndiscrimination, hate or violence against a\nperson or group because of their race,\ncolour or national or ethnic origin, as\nwell as racial advertisements or notices,\nand punishes those who publicly resolve\nto practice race discrimination. The Ger-\nman criminal code prohibits incitement\nto violence and the stimulation of racial\nhatred, but contains no laws prohibiting\nacts of discrimination in public places or\nin the fields of employment or housing.\nThe law in Germany, in fact, provides\nprotection in practice only to the Jewish\npopulation and does not address prob-\nlems faced by other minority groups.\nThe Danish criminal code, in addi-\ntion to punishing discrimination in the\nfield of employment and in access to\npublic facilities, fills in the gap left by\nlaws such as the British one which pun-\nishes incitement because of the effect it\nmay or does have on the public. In Den-\nmark, it is a criminal offence to make\nthreatening, hateful or degrading state-\nments about race, colour, nationality or\nethnic origin with the intention of dis-\nWhat does the post-1992 future hold for Black Europeans?\nprisoned, editors and distributors of dis-\ncriminatory ideas can be disqualified\nfrom further pursuance of their occupa-\ntions if they are convicted twice for the\nsame violation in five years. It is also a\ncriminal offence in the Netherlands to\ntake part in or support in any way activi-\nties which discriminate against people on\nracial grounds, or to discriminate in the\nexercise of a profession or trade.\nIt is important to note that not only\ndoes the Treaty of Rome and the Single\nEuropean Act fail to mention race, but\nthat the Commission's own publications\non social policy issues speak only of\nwomen, the long-term unemployed and\nthe disabled. In fact, this colour-blind\napproach contrasts sharply with meas-\nures on women's issues:\n* Since 1975 discrimination against\nwomen is illegal\n* There is a standing Committee of\nthe European Parliament on Women's\nRights\n* There is a Bureau for Questions on\nEmployment and Equal Treatment\nfor Women within the Commission\n*\nThe Advisory Committee on Equal\nOpportunities for Men and Women\nhas observer status.\nAnd race and racism?\n* Publication of a Committee of En-\nquiry findings on the Rise of Fascism\nand Racism in Europe, December\n1985\n*\nA declaration by the 3 Community\ninstitutions against racism and xeno-\nphobia.\nIt is not surprising therefore that fears\nhave already been expressed that the vi-\nsion of an integrated Europe will be a\nnightmare for the victims of an inte-\ngrated racism. Professor Chris Mullard\nof the University of Amsterdam warns\nthat \"what 1992 represents is a transfor-\nmation of nationalism into a white con-\ntinentalism, altogether more tight, resil-\nient and with more power\". The neces-\nsity for a cheap reservoir of labour to\nmassage the economic cohesion by\nwhich European capital is able to chal-\nlenge American and Japanese capital re-\nsults in some social cost and political dis-\nlocation.\nThe emphasis of the Commission's\nown social action programme tends to re-\ninforce this view of an integrated white\nEurope. In looking at education in a\nunited Europe, the emphasis is on the\npreparation for life in a single market\neconomy and one component of this is\nthe need to give greater prominence to\nlanguage training and the appreciation of\nEuropean cultures. What does this really\nmean? One can only look to expressed\nattitudes to begin to understand how this\nsocial action can be used to further deny\nethnic minorities a place in Europe.\nThe danger is that greater validity\nwill be given to European languages thus\nundermining the linguistic and cultural\ncapital of many ethnic minorities whose\nmother tongue is not a European lan-\nguage. The Department of Education\nand Science in its draft statutory order\nand circular of 3rd March 1989 entitled:\n\"Modern Foreign Languages in the Na-\ntional Curriculum\", advises educational\ninstitutions that EEC languages should\nhave priority in the National Curriculum.\nHowever, there is one concession to\nthose pupils who may choose Arabic,\nBengali, Chinese, Gujurati, Hindi, Japa-\nnese, Punjabi, Russian, Turkish and\nUrdu as their foundation subject lan-\nguage but ONLY if the school also offers\na chance of studying a European lan-\nguage. Europe's ethnic identity is thus\nbeing explicitly moulded in anticipation\nof 1992.\nIn all its recent publications, the\nCommission has been stressing that the\nsocial dimension is a fundamental aspect\n-10 The Black Parliamentarian\nThe Black Parliamentarian - 11-",
            "of the internal market \"for it is not only a\nmatter of strengthening economic\ngrowth and stepping up the external\ncompetitiveness of European undertak-\nings, but also of using more efficiently\nand more completely all the resources\navailable and of achieving a fair share-\nout of the advantages deriving from the\nsingle market\". This \"share-out of the\nadvantages\" will, it is argued, result in\nsubstantial improvements in the quality\nof life, employment, conditions of work,\naccess to promotion, housing, urban re-\ngeneration and training.\nThe benefits that are likely to accrue\nfor ethnic minorities are not assured. It is\naccepted that the economic measures\nthat will follow from a single market will\nnot only affect the spatial allocation of\neconomic activity but also transform so-\ncial life. But for ethnic minorities, this\ntransformation can be for the worse. Liv-\ning conditions of ethnic minorities will\nbe affected by the economic restructur-\ning being proposed and an analysis of the\nsocial implications will necessitate iden-\ntification of the range of discontinuities\nand shifts that are dominant in the mainly\nurban environment where most of us\nlive.\nA delineation of the living conditions\nin 1992 that are likely to impinge most on\nthe lives of Europe's ethnic minority\ncommunities would include the effect of\nfamily and household functions, shifts in\nmale/female roles, the changing nature\nof the labour market, levels of long-term\nunemployment, the growth of single par-\nenthood, rigidities in housing provision,\nrelations between generations and\namong racial communities, policing and\nnotions of fear and safety.\nIt is being argued that all of these fac-\ntors together with the consolidation of ra-\ncism will act as barriers to the majority of\nEurope's black citizens benefiting from\n1992. Occupational, industrial, social\nand spatial mobility will indeed result for\nsignificant numbers of individuals\nwithin the 12 member states but others\n-and I am arguing that this includes the\nvast majority of ethnic minorities - will\nbe confronted by additional constraints,\nthus making them economically, socially\nand spatially trapped in the inner cities of\ntheir own countries. This is further com-\npounded by the fixed physical infrastruc-\nture of most of our cities resulting in less\nchoice over access to quality and location\nof housing accommodation.\nThe economic strategy does include\nproposals for dealing with different lev-\nels of prosperity between regions. What\nis not specified is the recognition for\nexample, in the remodelling of the Com-\nmunity's Structural Funds of the de-\nbilitating effects of multiple urban depri-\nvation and racism existing side by side\nwith pockets of economic and industrial\n-12 The Black Parliamentarian\nprosperity within one region or urban\ncentre.\nThe net effect of all this will be less\nopportunities for ethnic minority fami-\nlies to participate freely in the free move-\nment guaranteed by 1992. This social\nand spatial concentration of ethnic mi-\nnority groups in the decaying urban areas\nis part of a more permanent process of\nmarginalisation by which interrelated\neconomic, social and political processes\ncombine to entrench and trap ethnic mi-\nnorities and the poor into geographical\nand economic spaces that are worse off\nthan their affluent and mainly white\nneighbours.\nThis scenario will be the landscape\nfor increasing problems of social\npolarisation and exacerbation of racial\ntensions and uprisings. With this will\ncome a strengthening of the stereotypical\nand racist notions of ethnic minorities.\nAdditionally, the removal of internal\ncontrols will result in the harmonisation\nof political asylum and refugee policies\nby 1992. Thus a refusal to admit a\nwould-be refugee by one country will\ncount as a refusal by all 12 members. Al-\nready there is evidence of a growing\ntoughness among some of the member\nstates to increase the chances for denying\nentry to individuals. In 1987 Britain\npassed the Immigration (Carriers Liabil-\nity) Act which stipulated a £1,000 fine\nfor any airline who carries a passenger\nwithout proper documentation.\nThere is also a tendency for ministers\nto link asylum-seekers and refugees with\ndrug trafficking, terrorism and illegal\nacts (Trevi Group of EC Ministers of Jus-\ntice and the Interior, Confidential Report\nto MPs by Douglas Hurd, Home Secre-\ntary). It will be easy for member states to\nimpose greater and more stringent inter-\nnal controls with immigration checks\nconducted at the workplace and before\nthe receipt of benefits and with greater\npolice surveillance becoming more com-\nmonplace. Harassment of black people\nEthnic minorities in these industries\nwill face greater risks of redundancies\nthat will inevitably result from industrial\nrestructuring. To offset this, it is impera-\ntive that an integrated, European-wide\nprogramme of training, retraining, job\ncreation, investment and economic de-\nvelopment be planned before 1992.\nThe Cecchini Report: \"The European\nChallenge: 1992\", in looking at the im-\nplications for employment, anticipates\nan increase of at least 1.8 million jobs in\nthe Community. The relaxing of the ma-\njor economic constraints — inflation,\nunemployment, public and trade deficits\ncan result in further growth: \"an in-\ncrease in GDP (Gross Domestic Product)\nof almost 6.5% and jobs creation of the\norder of 4 million\".\nUnfortunately, there is little evidence\nto show that ethnic minorities, trapped in\nthe urban centres, will benefit from these\n4 million jobs. Therefore, the social con-\nsequences of under and unemployment\nwill remain entrenched and there will be\nlittle effect to the growing marginalisa-\ntion referred to above. In addition, some\nconcerns must be expressed about other\nsocial implications for which there is in-\nsufficient information:\n* The need to safeguard the rights of\nundocumented workers?\n* Will the improvement of the levels\nof employment protection and work-\ning conditions benefit Black workers\nin sweatshop?\nconditions or lead to unemployment\n* Will equality considerations be in-\ncorporated in the new European stan-\ndards in contract procedures for\nworks, supplies and services?\n* What will be the status of qualifica-\ntions gained \"overseas\" within the mu-\ntual recognition of professional quali-\nfications?\n* How would welfare benefits, pen-\nwill inevitably increase, further height- sion rights, leave entitlement etc be\nening polarisation, marginalisation and\nunrest.\nThe South-Eastern part of Great Brit-\nain stands to benefit most from the single\nmarket as the opening of the Channel\nTunnel will boost economic develop-\nment in the area. The effects on those in-\ndustries - construction, clothing, tele-\ncommunications and food and drink\nwhich employ most Black people need to\nbe assessed. In Europe as a whole, the\nmotor and components industries are\nlikely to face widespread mergers, plant\nclosures, joint ventures or take-overs.\nBy 1990, predictions are that there will\nbe a world-wide excess of nine million\nbe a world-wide excess of nine million\nunits which represent over 20% more\ncars and trucks than is predicted on the\ndemand side.\ntransferred?\nOn balance, it is safe to say that the\nsocial implications of 1992 will result in\nthe creation of what is being referred .to\nas \"the new poor\" or \"underclass\". To\nthis group is ascribed the characteristics\nof ethnicity and criminality. There is lit-\ntle opportunity to escape these labels de-\nspite freedom to move from one region\nor nation to another. For ethnic minori-\nties, 1992 is approached with trepidation\nand fear and therefore there is a clear re-\nsponsibility on us all to face up to these\nimplications and strive, as part of a\nunited European network, to develop not\nonly a general awareness of the issues\nbut a platform for structural and institu-\ntional change.\nWOW!\nNEW & IMPROVED\nDARK & LOVELY\nNO-LYE RELAXERS\nNow the best is even better.\nWhen you experience new,\nimproved Dark & Lovely and\nDark & Lovely Plus, you'll see and\nfeel the difference right away.\nLong lasting Dark & Lovely relaxers\nwill give you soft, silky, healthy\nlooking hair with more body and\nmanageability for easy styling\nversatility.\nDark & Lovely relaxers also give\nyou added protection against\nover-processing and damage with\nPre-Care Pre-Relaxer Treatment,\nColor Signal Shampoo and Color\nMixer Activator.\nSo go with the number one\nrelaxer, Dark & Lovely.\nNew and improved Dark & Lovely.\nWow!\nNow more than ever,\nAhhh, the pleasure of\nDARK\nLOVELY\nWarning: Follow directions carefully to avoid skin and\nscalp irritation, hair breakage and eye injury.\nNEW & IMPROVED\nSOFTER SAKIR HAIR\nLONG LASTING RESULTS\nDARK\nLOVELY\nNO-LYE\nCONDITIONING\nRELAXER SYSTEM\nFOR ALL HAIR\nTEXTURES\nDARK\nLOVELY\nPlus\nNO-LYE\nCONDITIONING\nRELAXER SYSTEM\nFOR DIFFICULT\nTO RELAX HAIR\nNEW & IMPROVED\nFOR\nSOFTER.

            "RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE:\nWhat's the Price for Britain's Muslims\nBy Keith Vaz, MP (Leicester East)\nIt is a historical fact that the adjustment made by immigrant communities to their \"hosts\" is greater than the\nability of the host community to accommodate. And that the right to belong is as important a concept as the\nright to be different. This assertion of difference, this protection of culture, has manifested itself indelibly on\nthe landscape of Britain.\nYou only have to walk around the\ninner areas of our great cities and you\ncan see this manifestation over the\nrooftops. They may not be as grand\nas the Central Mosque in Birming-\nham or the Sanatan Mandir in Leices-\nter or the Gudwaras in Southall but\nthey are there.\nTo British people used to two\ngreat religions - headed by Rome\nand Canterbury these new relig-\nions are at once an object of interest\nand a threat. There are three reasons\nfor this. First, a crucial lack of un-\nderstanding that the \"new\" religions\nare in fact old ones with long and\ngreat histories which rival Christian-\nity. Second, the fact that the Chris-\ntian religion has less and less mean-\ning in the life of the nation. Third,\nthere is no understanding of the role\nthat religion plays in the lives of the\nnew communities.\nI don't often go in for prayers at\nthe start of the Parliamentary day but\nI did so twice in one week not so long\nago. Here in Westminster, a handful\nof MPs were praying. The Chaplain\nasked for God's blessing on the de-\nliberations to come. This is how the\nParliamentary day begins every day.\nIt reminded me of the meetings that I\nhave attended all over the country\nwith British Muslims who begin\ntheir events with a recitation of the\nKoran. This occurs every time a\nmeeting takes place.\nThe great mistake of the pro-\nRushdie supporters has been their to-\ntal failure to grasp the role of Islam in\nthe lives of Muslims: the central na-\nture of the religion to the tedium of\neveryday life. Devotion is described\nas fanaticism. Those who have op-\nposed the stupidity of Rushdie's de-\ncision to write and publish a book\nthat is steeped in intolerance and re-\nligious abuse, are branded as sup-\nporters of the fanatics.\nporters of the fanatics. Yet they\ndon't realise that all those who be\nlieve, all those who pray are by their\nnature fanatics. How strong is your\nbelief in your religion if you don't\nbelieve in its fundamental values?\nFaith is something to be respected\nand revered; not to be used as an op-\nportunity to humiliate and to poke\nfun at.\nWe owe, perversely, a debt of\ngratitude to Rushdie for the contro-\nversy and thoughts that he has pro-\nvoked. The reaction of the Left, the\nGovernment, the Opposition, the lib-\neral establishment, the police, the\nmedia etc. has been striking. A re-\nmarkable coalition of all classes and\nall shades of opinion has combined\nto brandish the burners of Rushdie's\nbooks and effigies as fanatics. At the\nsame time, they barely comment on\nthe councillors who burn their Poll\nTax notices or the irate residents who\ncreated and burnt an effigy of the\nSecretary of State for the Environ-\nment. No questions are asked here\nabout fanatics and fundamentalists.\n21 years earlier, Enoch Powell, in a\ndifferent way, was uttering the same\nsentiments as Rushdie. Dockers\nmarched to defend Powell's right to\nfree speech in the same way 12,000\nelites rallied to defend Rushdie.\nThey were lecturing the new relig-\nions and the new Britons by reassert-\ning what they described as the funda-\nmental principle: to be British is to\naccept the rule of law. That is not a\nparticularly British concept. All\ndemocratic societies operate on the\nbasis of the rule of law.\nYet in exchange for citizenship,\nAsians are now being asked to strip\nthemselves naked of not just their\nreligion but their culture. Elderly\nAsian men and women are regularly\ndenied naturalisation because they\ncannot speak English; even though\nfor the remainder of their lives, be-\ncause of their life-styles, they are ab-\nsolutely unlikely to have the need to\nspeak English. Yet a new identity is\nto be imposed on them. They must be\nsanitized from 1,000 years of history.\nCulture must begin at Terminal\nThree at Heathrow Airport. Nothing\nelse matters. It's as if they have cre-\nated a drug that would turn us all into\none colour a true Aryan race for\nThatcher's Fourth Reich. Then once\nwe are all the same colour with a\ncommon history, then our women\nwill be liberated.\nNo more sinks, children and ar-\nranged marriages. Asian women, in\nparticular Muslim women, are to be\nliberated by the liberal establish-\nment. I'm sure I went to a synagogue\nrecently where they placed the\nwomen in a different part of the room\nfrom the men. There were no dem-\nonstrators outside urging the Jewish\nreligion to liberate its women. Jews\nare now part of the establishment so\neveryone has a go at Muslims. They\nare locked in their social cages wait-\ning to be released by Fay Weldon.\nWeldon's new pamphlet, \"Sacred\nCows\", is the latest defence of\nRushdie and latest attack on the Ko-\nran. Ms Weldon: \"The Koran is food\nfor no-thought\". It's a straightfor-\nward anti-Muslim piece which\nmakes \"The Satanic Verses\" look\nlike a comic. An international con-\nference held in Kuwait in 1980 and\nsponsored by the International Com-\nmission of Jurists recognised that the\nequal rights of women is a vital\nteaching of the Koran. There was no\nquestion of second-class status. Dur-\ning the recent Pakistani elections,\nobservers noted the huge personal\nvote generated to elect the first\nwoman leader of an Islamic state.\nMuslim women groups established\nin Britain are a vital and necessary\npart of the way in which the commu-\nnity develops. They are as valid as\nthe leaders of the religion.\nTo mock the new religions, to\ngoad them, is to rob a whole genera-\ntion of their rights to have roots and\nfeelings and to store up immense\nproblems for the future. 21 years\nfrom now we will look back and see\nwhat damage Rushdie has really\ndone. Powell at least had a motive\nfor what he did with a clear idea of\nthe precise perils that lay ahead.\nRushdie wrote a work of fiction that\nEQUEST ADVERTISING\n&\nPROMOTIONS LIMITED.\n(U.K's No.1 Black Advertising Agency)\n*Head Office:\n*\nAdministration :\nSERVICES\n15 COLVIN ROAD\nEAST HAM, LONDON E6 1JJ\nPOPLAR LIBRARY,\n44 GILLENDER STREET,\nPOPLAR\nLONDON E14 6RN\nTEL: 01 552 2730\n*PRINTING *ART\\DESIGN\n*MARKETING \\ P.R. *PROMOTIONS\n*DESK TOP PUBLISHING\n*PHOTOGRAPHY VIDEO\n(THE COMPLETE IN-HOUSE SERVICE COMPANY)\nTHE WAY FORWARD IS WITH EQUEST\nhas managed to let loose a million\nsentiments whose desire to mould\nthe Black communities go beyond\nPowell's wildest dreams.\nThe new religions must be left to\ndevelop in their own way: aware that\nthey are not in their countries of ori-\ngin; that they are minority religions;\nthat they are in another place which\nhas less tolerance and understanding\nthan they were entitled to expect.\nAffirmata\n6 TURNPIKE LANE LONDON N8 OPT\nTEL: 01-881 4724\nAFFIRMATA LTD - the professionals in Equal\nOpportunities and Management Training.

            "ENDING HUNGER\nIt was with great sadness that the PBC learnt of the death of Mickey Leland, the Democratic Congressman for Texas, a\ncrusader against world hunger.\nThere were no survivors when Mickey's plane, with 17 people on board, crashed into mountains in Ethio-\npia, about three hundred miles from Addis Ababa. He was leading a delegation on a visit to a camp for 30,000\nSudanese refugees. In tribute to Mickey's mission to put \"the poor, the starving and the dispossessed\" on the\npolitical agenda, we reprint his article, 'Ending Hunger', published a year ago in the Congressional Black\nCaucus' magazine, \"Point of View\".\nAt least 20 million Americans do not\nhave an adequate diet on a consistent ba-\nsis. They suffer from hunger. They are\nwithin the poorest one-fifth of the popu-\nlation that receives less than five percent\nof the family income while the wealthiest\none-fifth receives 44 percent of the na-\ntion's family income.\nHunger and poverty are inextricably\nbound both in the reality of empty cup-\nboards in the homes of the poor and in the\nconcepts used for study and analysis.\nPoor people do not have enough money\nto buy sufficient food for an adequate\ndiet. The official poverty guidelines\noriginated with the \"economy food plan\"\nof the U.S. Department of Agriculture\nmultiplied by a factor of three, based on\nthe assumption that a family spent one-\nthird of its income on food. Today, those\nwith the lowest incomes expend nearly\n43 percent of their income on food.\nThe federal food programs that were\nput in place to prevent hunger have been\nundermined by a concerted effort by the\nReagan Administration. Forty percent of\nthe people in poverty do not get food\nstamps; those who do get them find it dif-\nficult to eat on 51 cents a meal. Because\nthe total benefit is inadequate for a\nmonth, the food gap is filled by the ever-\ngrowing network of food banks, soup\nkitchens and pantries. A just and equita-\nble society should not depend on emer-\ngency food distribution to remedy hun-\nger.\nFood programs must be restored and\nexpanded until they provide for all the\nhungry. We cannot expect people to\nhave the energy and drive required to\nemerge from poverty in this rigorous,\ncompetitive society without proper nu-\ntrition. Today, all poor Americans are\nBy Rep. Mickey Leland (D.TX)\nsuffering from restrictive application\npolicies and insufficient benefits.\nThere must be increased information\nand outreach about food stamps, the food\nprogram for young and old, working and\nnot working. There must be greater ac-\ncess to the program, less red tape in ap-\nplication and more experimentation with\nmethods of reducing stigma, including\ncash-out and credit cards.\nProper nutrition is crucial in the early\nmonths of life. The Special Supplemen-\ntal Food Program for Women, Infants\nand Children (WIC) provides necessary\nnutrients to improve pregnancy out-\ncomes and enhance development. Low\nbirth weight is the most significant factor\nin infant mortality rates. The United\nStates has fallen behind other in-\ndustrialised nations in reducing infant\nmortality. It now ranks 17th. Histori-\ncally, the Black infant mortality rate has\nremained twice that of the white infant\nmortality rate. If the minority differen-\ntial could be eliminated, the United\nStates would move back into a lead posi-\nStates would move back into a lead posi-\ntion. To achieve improved infant mortal-\nity rates, WIC should be available to\nevery low-income mother and child at\nnutritional risk. Now, the program\nreaches only 40 percent of those eligible.\nalthough we know that the program is ex-\ntremely cost effective.\nAccording to research, low income\nindividuals are often deficient in vita-\nmins A and C. These vitamins are found\nin fresh fruits and vegetables which peo-\nple often forego because they are expen-\nsive and often unavailable. A new pro-\ngram for WIC families to address this\nsituation has been proposed in the Farm-\ners' Market Nutrition Enhancement Act.\nIt establishes a pilot program to give the\nWIC families coupons to buy fresh pro-\nduce at farmers' markets.\nThe program is based on successful\nmodels in Massachusetts, Iowa, Con-\nnecticut and Vermont. Experience there\nhas shown that increased sales encourage\nfarmers' markets in low income neigh-\nbourhoods and that residents of these\ncommunities have been receptive to\nfarmers' markets, often gaining access to\nhigh quality produce for the first time.\nRecognising the importance of early\nchildhood development, the Head Start\nProgram was established in the 1960s. It\ncombined education, nutrition programs\nand parental involvement, nurturing both\nmind and body and proved cost effective.\nYet, the Head Start Program has been cut\nback drastically. Waiting lists abound. It\nis imperative that almost five million\npoor children in the nation, a majority of\nwhom are minorities, have the opportu-\nnity this program affords.\nImprovement and expansion of the\nchild nutrition programs is required for\nan improved impact on eight million\nschool-age poor children. Most receive\nfree or reduced price school lunches, but\nschool breakfast and summer food serv-\nice programs reach only a small number\nof eligible poor children. Less than four\nmillion children receive school break-\nfast. This means that there are four mil-\nlion children in school whose morning\nhours may be wasted. Less than 1.5 mil-\nlion partake of summer food service, the\nonly food supplement available during\nthe summer months.\nNutritional vulnerability is common\nto youth and the aged. Three and a half\nmillion elderly live in poverty with the\nattendant nutritional shortfalls. Among\nthe poor elderly, fifty-three percent are\nchronically limited in their activity. The\nlevel of unmet need for congregate and\nhome-delivered meals has been widely\ndocumented. Shortened stays in hospi-\ntals following Medicare reform legisla-\ntion also increase the number of frail eld-\nerly needing home-delivered meals. The\nauthorisation of Title III-C elderly nutri-\ntion programs should be expanded to\nmeet the need.\nIn 1983, Congress authorised the dis-\ntribution of cheese, non-fat dry milk,\nflour and other commodities held in stor-\nage by the U.S. Department of Agricul-\nture for use at home by families. This\nwas in addition to traditional deliveries\nto school and charitable programs. Over\nthe years, millions of persons used these\ncommodities which reached them\nthrough local government and voluntary\nagencies. Now, many commodities are\nno longer in surplus and thus no longer\navailable. Provision should be made to\nassure that poor families who have come\nto rely on this source of food are not\nfaced with a sudden deprivation.\nClearly, the abundance of America\nshould not be wasted when people are\nhungry. Legislation to encourage glean-\ning and the contribution of food from\ncommercial sources should be enacted\nand expanded where necessary. This in-\ncludes liability protection and tax incen-\ntives to donors.\nDuring the past decades, there have\nbeen continuing arguments about the ex-\nistence of hunger and the methods used\nto identify it. The Federal Government\nhas both the capacity and the responsibil-\nity to measure nutritional status and food\navailability and security. Millions of\nfederal dollars are spent on food con-\nsumption research to guide industry on\nsumption research to guide industry on\nfood trends of the middle class. There is\nno thorough study of the lack of food\nconsumption. Such surveys should be\nconducted and released on a timely basis,\nconducted and released on a timely basis,\nwith appropriate sub-samples to assure\nthat information about minorities who\nare at nutritional risk can be captured.\nBeyond benefits of nutrition pro-\ngrams, income support programs such as\nSupplemental Security Income (SSI) and\nAid for Families with Dependent Chil-\ndren (AFDC) must reach all who are eli-\ngible and must provide for minimal\nneeds more decently. Recent Congres-\nsional testimony indicated that only fifty\nto sixty percent of those eligible partici-\npate in SSI. The AFDC program benefits\nfall below 50 percent of the poverty line\nin thirty-two states. The reference to\nfamily in AFDC is a misnomer because\neconomic injustice and the failure of\nleadership in many sectors-but wages\nand housing are most significant.\nThe Federal budget tells the story. In\n1980, the Federal budget figures (with no\nadjustment for inflation) provided for\n$811.00 per person to national defence\nand $525.00 per person for low income\nprograms. By 1987, military expendi-\ntures had risen to $1,158.00 per person\nand per capita outlay for low income pro-\ngrams had shrunk to $492.00.\nIn such excess there is great waste.\nAn Allen wrench that cost the Depart-\nment of Defence $9,606.00 in taxpayers'\ndollars, would provide three four-person\nfamilies with food stamps for more than\na year. The cost of a single Trident nu-\nclear submarine -$1.2 billion - could\nbring the WIC program to most of those\nwho are eligible but not served for a year.\nin twenty-three states it is not available to The $148 billion interest on the national\ntwo-parent families.\ndebt for one year would pay for all the\nfood assistance programs for the next\nseven years.\nThe traditional path out of poverty\nand hunger has been employment. This\njourney requires support and incentive.\nUnfortunately, many newly created jobs\npay only the minimum wage, $3.35 an\nhour, a rate unchanged since 1981. There\ncan be no relief from hunger for families\nliving on wages that leave them far below\nthe poverty level even when the work is\nyear-round and full-time.\nIn the same way, lack of affordable\nhousing erodes a family's capacity to\npurchase an adequate diet. Federal sup-\nport for low income housing has fallen\neighty percent in the last decade. We see\nthe result in the homeless persons on the\nstreets and in shelters, but we do not see\nthe families who pay exorbitant rents and\nutilities and have little left for food and\nother necessities.

All Americans\n- but especially minorities who suffer\ndisproportionately should not be ex-\ncluded, as they largely have been, from\nsharing in the prosperity of the future.\nNor should they be forced to pay the bills\nof a spending-spree society which\ncharacterised the 1980s.\nThe American people demand re-\nsponsible government. It is tragic to rob\nhuman lives of their full potential be-\ncause of lack of the basic nutrients for\ngrowth and development. Freedom from\nhunger is a basic human right and a fun-\ndamental need.

            "(Photo: Humphrey Nemar)\nFREEDOM FOR NAMIBIA\nby Sean O'Donovan\nOne of the most inspiring developments in Southern Africa is the continuing victories of the people of Namibia\nover apartheid. But Sean O'Donovan writes that the situation is still fraught with great difficulty and danger,\nand that our solidarity is still vital.\nAs a result of the liberation\nstruggle under the leadership of\nNamibia's national liberation\nmovement, SWAPO, the South Af-\nrican government was finally\nforced to agree to the implementa-\ntion of the UN plan for the inde-\npendence of Namibia.\nSOLIDARITY\nWITH\nSWAPO!\nSWAPO leader Sam Nujoma in London\nThe creation of a sovereign and inde-\npendent state of Namibia, joining the\nranks of the Front Line States, will repre-\nsent a profound advance in the struggle to\nfree Africa of apartheid, racism and colo-\nnialism.\n-18 The Black Parliamentarian\n-\nThe South African Government\ndid not agree to the UN Plan because\nof a fundamental change of objec-\ntives in Southern Africa, but rather\ntives in Southern Africa, but rather\nbecause of the combination of the in-\nternal struggle and South Africa's\nmilitary defeats in Southern Angola.\nmilitary defeats in Southern Angola.\nThose defeats were in part due to the\ninternational arms embargo, and in\npart due to other sanctions which\nmade it increasingly unable to meet\nthe financial burden of its illegal ad-\nministration and occupation forces.\nThe clear lesson is that if partial\nsanctions were partially effective\nover Namibia then total mandatory\nsanctions would therefore be totally.\neffective and will lead to the total\nelimination of apartheid.\nThe long drawn out process of ne-\ngotiations began in May 1988 in\nLondon with the meeting between\nSouth Africa, the USA, Angola and\nCuba. SWAPO, crucially, were not\nincluded. Talks led to an agreement\nsigned on December 22nd 1988, and\nApril 1st was set as the commence-\nment of the implementation of the\nUN Plan. The election period starting\nin July 1989 leads to Constituent As-\nsembly elections in November. The\nparty, or group of parties, that re-\nceives at least two-thirds of the votes\nof the 670,000 electorate will then be\nmandated to write the Constitution of\na new Namibia. It is anticipated that\nindependence would then be secured\nafter a further five months.\nHowever, it soon became clear\nthat the preparations would be seri-\nously hampered by a critical deci-\nsion taken in the UN. That was the re-\nduction from 7,500 to 4,650 in the\nnumber of UN Transitional Assis-\ntance Group (UNTAG) to be sent to\nNamibia during the transition to in-\ndependence. As a direct result of the\ncutbacks in the military component,\nthere was no effective UN presence\nin much of Namibia on April 1st. The\nUN also failed to force South Africa\nto disband its para-military terror\nsquads known as Koevoet (Crow-\nbar). Instead Koevoet were merely\ntransferred to the regime's police\nforce (SWAPOL).\nOn April 1st, SWAPO forces\ncame in from the bush to surrender\ntheir arms to UN forces. They were\nmet instead by the heavily armed\nSouth African forces, including\nKoevoet, who committed acts of car-\nnage against Namibian civilians as\nwell as SWAPO combatants.\nIn a House of Commons debate\non 13th April, Bernie Grant MP, who\nis an Executive Committee member\nof the Anti-Apartheid Movement, re-\nminded the House that he first raised\nthe matter of UNTAG deployment at\nPrime Minister's Question Time on\n31st January 1989. Britain, as one of\nthe five permanent members of the\nUN Security Council, has a primary\nresponsibility to ensure the success\nof the UN Plan and could have in-\nsisted that the original number of\nUNTAG troops be maintained. In-\nstead Mrs Thatcher further aggra-\nvated the situation by her unfounded\nallegation that SWAPO was guilty of\na serious challenge to the authority of\nthe UN. In his speech Bernie Grant\nasked:\n\"Why did she seem to get every-\nthing wrong? Why was she so eager\nto accept the South African position?\nDid she not read - as I did - the report\nof the UN's representative in Na-\nmibia, which said that SWAPO did\nnot have any hostile intent? Did she\nnot think, 'Maybe I can give them\nthe benefit of the doubt?' Certainly\nnot. I suggest to the House that the\nPrime Minister is, indeed, a friend of\nthe racists and that she cannot stand\nthe idea of Namibian independence.\nThat is the fact of the matter\nSWAPO President, Sam Nujoma,\nsaid in August 1989, that the pros-\npects for free and fair elections still \"\nhangs in the balance\". Nearly all the\nNamibian media is owned by South\nAfrican sympathisers who faithfully\npromote the Democratic Turnhalle\nAlliance (DTA), SWAPO's main ri-\nvals in the elections. The media, par-\nticularly radio, is being used within\nNamibia to smear and distort\nSWAPO's election campaign. The\nBritish media is not much better, as\nthey invariably repeat unchallenged\nthe South African Government's re-\nport of any incident. South Africa is\nstill in effective control of Namibia,\nand evidence is emerging of terror\ntactics being used to intimidate any-\none prepared to support SWAPO.\nMany of SWAPO's leaders and ac-\ntivists have been imprisoned or oth-\nerwise harassed.\nIt is clear that SWAPO command\nwidespread support among the vast\nmajority of Namibian people. For in-\nstance the emerging trade union\nmovement, united in the National\nUnion of Namibian Workers\n(NUNW), has declared its full en-\ndorsement of SWAPO. The theme of\nNUNW's recent congress was: Vote\nfor SWAPO, Vote for Freedom,\nVote for Education, Vote for Peace.\nStudents, youth and women's or-\nganisations are all openly supporting\nSWAPO.\nHowever, this support will not be\ntranslated into votes unless SWAPO\nare given financial help to match the\nmoney made available to anti-\nBOYCOTT APARTHEID\nSUPPORT THE\nFRONT LINE STATES\nNew AA Enterprises mail order catalogue of\nanti-apartheid goods and gifts OUT NOW!\nMusic from the Kafala Brothers of Angola\n► Unusual wire toys from Zimbabwe\n► Greeting cards designed in Tanzania\nDelicious cashew nut spread from\nMozambique\n► Exclusive new garments with the sanctions\nmessage & lots lots more.\nSWAPO alliances by South Africa.\nApart from election expenses,\nSWAPO also need to provide for the\ntens of thousands of returning refu-\ngees.\nThe Anti-Apartheid Movement\nhas recently launched the SWAPO\nElection Campaign Appeal to raise\nmoney for SWAPO during the Elec-\ntion period.

            "BE MY CHILD:\nONE WOMAN'S STORY\nOF HER STRUGGLE TO ADOPT\nIn 1987, I decided to apply to become\nan adopter. As a Black woman (from a\nBlack-White marriage), working, sin-\ngle and over fifty, I was not sure of my\nchances. However, I thought that I\nwould make a good mother; and fam-\nily and friends supported me.\nI was fortunate in having a supportive\nand pragmatic social worker. After six\nmonths of detailed casework, I was ac-\ncepted by my local adoption panel as an\nadopter. I decided I would like a Black\nchild between 5 and 8 years.\nMy Borough Social Services after\nsome time said that they had no children\navailable within the age range I wanted.\nThe adoption service was not operating\nbecause of staff shortages. It was even\ndifficult to get hold of the \"Be My Parent\nBook\". This is a regularly-updated book\ncarrying profiles of children available for\nadoption.\nEventually, I decided to apply out-\nside my Borough. The local bureaucrats\nthen stepped in. I belonged to them, they\nsaid, and could not apply elsewhere for a\nchild until I was on their books for 12\nmonths. This was in spite of there being\na national standing arrangement that a lo-\ncal authority pays if they use an adopter\nfrom another authority or organisation.\nFollowing a formal protest from myself\nand intervention from others, I was even-\ntually allowed to look for a child else-\nwhere.\nI tracked down the \"Be My Parent\nBook\" early in 1988 and found a child I\nwas interested in \"Sophie\", aged 7\nyears. She had a white mother and a fa-\nther born to an inter-racial couple in Af-\nrica. The child's history was that she\nwas taken into care because her mother\nwas a drug addict. The father was in\nprison for selling drugs. The mother was\ndeemed totally unable and unfit to care\nfor the child. The father was thought un-\nsuitable to continue his parental role.\nThis in spite of him being continually in\ntouch with Sophie. She visited him in\nprison and he wrote to her often. The re-\nlationship was mutually affectionate.\n-20- The Black Parliamentarian\nBy Dorothy Kuya\nThere was no evidence of abuse of the\nchild. Her grandmother from Africa also\nwrote to her.\nI was short-listed by her authority but\nit took three months for a meeting to hap-\npen. During the interview with her social\nworker, the adoption worker and my own\nsocial worker, I was asked very few\nquestions. I'd expected an interrogative\nline of questioning; after all a child's life\nwould be in my hands. I found that I had\nto ask many questions to get information.\nI was told that the child thought that she\nwas white and that it was the job of the\nadopter to deal with that issue. I was also\ntold that when the child was adopted she\nwould forget her past and start a new life.\nIt appeared that my living in a 'walk-up\nflat' - that is a flat with no lifts was\nnot viewed with approval as the child had\nlived in one with her parents. I did not\nhold out much hope. I thought the inter-\nview was a disaster and was not surprised\ntherefore, when I was not accepted. A\nBlack couple was chosen.\nThat particular placing failed. I later\ndiscovered that there had been various\nattempts to place Sophie with both Black\nand white families. They had all failed.\nHowever, three Black single women had\napplied. Each of us was rejected because\nwe were single. In the meanwhile, the fa-\nther had finished his prison sentence and\nwas objecting to the child being adopted.\nHe wanted her to be with him. He went to\ncourt and lost his case. Sophie continued\nto be up for adoption until the summer of\n1989. The last I heard is that she is to be\nadopted by a white family.\nThere were other children I was inter-\nested in. But, because of my age and fail-\nure to marry, I was not considered suit-\nable by some local authorities. Most of\nthe children in the \"Be My Parent Book\",\nwere described as needing a mother and\nfather. There appeared to be a preference\non the part of many adoption depart-\nments and organisations to keep a child\nin care until a 'perfect couple' could be\nfound. This meant, as in the case of\nSophie, waiting in an institution for up to\nthree years before being placed.\nMy social worker went on maternity\nleave. Because of staff shortages, I had\nno social worker for about 6 months. I\nthen began to contact social workers and\nagencies around the country. I came\nacross a lot of Black children who had\nbeen in care for many years with many\ndifferent white foster parents, or in\nhomes. Most of them were having psy-\nchiatric help as they were classed as be-\ning emotionally disturbed. They were\nconfused about their racial identity and\noften described themselves as being\nwhite.\nThe same local authority who would\nnot allow me to adopt Sophie also re-\njected me when I applied for an older boy\nwho was said to be 'emotionally dis-\nturbed'. He was with white foster par-\nents while awaiting adoption. My single\nstate was again the criteria for rejection.\nI identified another girl, \"Josie\" aged\n7, born in England of African parentage.\nHer history is very complicated. Put sim-\nply however, her mother was in prison\nawaiting trial for drug trafficking. Josie\nwas already in care when that happened.\nShe had been put up for adoption, the\nmother objected. The social worker was\nconvinced that the mother, who was a\nforeign national, would be found guilty\nand deported. She had no intention of let-\nting the child, who was a British subject,\ngo abroad with the mother; although as in\nthe case of Sophie, there was no history\nof abuse or evidence that she would be\nneglected.\nThe social worker had met the\nmother for one hour only in prison. The\nmother, in the meanwhile, wanted the\nchild to go to an Aunty. The social\nworker made no attempt to contact the\nAunty, and was keen to place the child\nwith me. However, as the mother was\nopposing the adoption, and I believed\nthat the social worker was being heavy-\nhanded and unfair in dealing with her, I\nrefused to go ahead with the adoption.\nThe last I heard was that the social\nworker had been instructed by the\nGuardian Ad Litem (the child's repre-\nsentative in court) to contact the Aunty.\nI was becoming adept at asking\nsearching questions, particularly in try-\ning to ascertain the reason for the child\nbeing in care. I was also becoming very\nconcerned at social workers' keenness to\nhave children adopted away from the\nchild's family, rather than exploring pos-\nsibilities within the family, for example\ngrandparents, aunts etc.\nSome time later, I was telephoned\nfrom another local authority about a little\ngirl. I told them I was interested. But\nthey later changed the girl to a boy,\n\"John\". I agreed to meet the social\nworker to discuss him. I was told that\nthey would want the child's Black foster\nparent to be present, as they had no Black\nfostering and adoption workers. I was\nnot happy about a foster parent being one\nof my assessors, but felt I had no option.\nJohn was a child of a white mother who\nwas always abandoning him. There was\na white grandmother who was described\nas having a casually affectionate attitude\ntowards him. Amazingly, the father-a\nCaribbean - was not mentioned at all.\nThe birth of the child took place in\ncircumstances which indicated that the\nfather might not even know he had a\nchild. The social worker, who was new\nto the child, knew the father's name and\nthat he and his parents lived near to her\narea office. But no attempt had been\nmade to contact him. I pointed out the\nimportance of the father being contacted.\nThere was a possibility that he or his par-\nents might like to have the child and that\nthis should be explored. I was told that it\nwas not usual in such circumstances for a\nfather to be approached. I was also asked\nby the social worker how she could do\nthis. It was a ridiculous question in view\nof my not living in her area, and the fact\nthat the Caribbean social workers in the\narea would be more likely to help in iden-\ntifying him than me.\nA few months following this inter-\nview, my \"f form\" was returned. This\nform is the detailed profile prepared by\nthe social worker and the adopter for use\nby interested authorities and agencies. It\nwas clear that the particular authority no\nlonger wanted to deal with me.\nThe most recent case I've been in-\nvolved in concerns a little girl from the\nMidlands called \"Jane\". Because of\nthere being no social worker, I had to ne-\ngotiate on my own. I arranged for my \"f\nform\" to be sent by my area office to the\ncontact social worker. I had a number of\nlong discussions on the phone. There\nwas to be a team meeting. Three families\nwere 'bidding' for Jane. I was asked to\nsend a photo. I was surprised about this\nand was assured that everyone did it. It\nwas worrying to think that my looks\nwould be assessed as well as my very de-\ntailed \"fform\". A 'phone call a day after\nthe team meeting told me that I was not\nselected.\nAmong the reasons given was that\nthe child was very boisterous and that\n\"you both would be screaming at each\nother eventually\". Also living in a flat\nwas viewed as not desirable. There was\nno evidence in my \"f form\" of my being\nthe screaming type. My flat is pleasantly\nsituated, with a playground for children\nof the child's age range. I'd set aside the\nlargest room for the child. It is certainly\nnot a pokey place.\nWhen Jane was advertised in the \"Be\nMy Parent Book\", she was said to need a\nstrong male in her adopting family.\nWhen detailing her history, her social\nworker told me that she had been sexu-\nally abused by the two men with whom\nher mother had cohabited. The social\nworker was not able to tell me why in the\ncircumstances, a strange male figure was\nthought desirable in her adopting family.\nI also contacted a national organisa-\ntion which told me it had suitable chil-\ndren on its list. They had used a leading\nBlack figure to encourage more Black\nadopters. They said there was a shortage.\nThe first question asked on the 'phone\nwas my age. I refused to give it, and told\nthem my name was more important. A\nsecond 'phone call got me through to the\nperson in charge. We arranged an ap-\npointment. She was sent my \"f form\".\nOne of the questions she asked at the in-\nterview was: \"if you died, do you have\nsomeone to take over the child?\". She\nmeant family or friends. I had never been\nasked that one before. How could I ask\nmy family/friends to agree, in the event\nof my death, to take on a child that I had\nnot even seen? Not even biological par-\nents are expected to make that sort of ar-\nrangement. The interview left me dis-\nmayed. I heard nothing more about pro-\nspective adoptees from her, although she\nwrote and said she would be in touch\nagain. One interesting point from her\nwas that she had on her list a child from\nmy Borough of the right age - although\nmy Borough purported to have no suit-\nable children.\nAnother national adoption agency\nforgot to put me on its computer for 12\nmonths. When it did, the worker con-\ncerned was suggesting children who\nwere mentally and physically disabled. I\nhad made it clear that as a single woman I\nwould not be able to cope with a child\nwith a physical or mental disability. I felt\nwith a physical or mental disability. I felt\nvery much under pressure to accept such\na child, and that the fitter children were\nbeing kept for the 'ideal couple'. An-\nother local authority who had a child of\nthe age range I was interested in, did not\nhave a social worker to take on her case.\nMy experiences relate to various parts of\nthe country and with authorities of differ-\nent political persuasions.\nThe two years that I have been regis-\ntered as an adopter have been disturbing\nin what they reveal of social work prac-\ntice as it relates to children in care and\nfostering and adoption procedures. I've\nheard from a number of people that there\nare national procedures. If that is the\ncase, they are not being practised. I felt\nthat each social worker I met was moving\nthe goal posts, and that a great deal of\nsubjectivity was involved in assessments\nof both children up for adoption and\nadopters.\nThere was not enough clarity about\nhow to make an appropriate match be-\ntween a child and potential adopters.\nChoices seem to be made on gut reac-\ntions, personal prejudices based on a tra-\nditional white middle-class view of the\nperfect family-a house with a garden, a\nman, a woman and a dog. There are also\nwidely-held stereotypical attitudes to-\nwards older, single women.\nI have the impression that not enough\nthought is being given to placing a child\nfor fostering or adoption with other\nmembers of its family. Imprisonment for\nselling drugs is used as a reason for put-\nting the accused person's child up for\nadoption.\nMany Black children in care or fos-\ntered by white people for many years\nusually have no sense of their own Black\nidentity and consequently have problems\ndealing with racial discrimination when\nthey meet with it in school and on the\nstreets.\nI have met many Black people want-\ning to adopt and foster who are meeting\nwith obstructions. Black social workers,\nwhite and Black friends, lawyers and\nothers confirm my experiences as not be-\ning unusual. Mr Mellor (the Health Min-\nister) would do well to look at the whole\nof the adoption and fostering procedures\nand guidelines and not just investigate a\nparticular case. Professor Tizard's re-\nsearch (commissioned by the Govern-\nment) will not carry much credibility if\nonly her personal experiences with her\nBlack adopted daughter are used.\nThe two years for me have been frus-\ntrating and very demanding emotionally.\nMy fear is that two years on from being\naccepted as an adopter will see my age\nincreasingly being used to reject me.\nAnd with the present debate on how won-\nderful white foster and adoptive parents\nare, the opportunities for any Black per-\nson to adopt a Black child will lessen.\nThe Black Parliamentarian -21-",

To complete\nthe party, there was a distinguished dele-\ngation representing the Congressional\nBlack Caucus Foundation which pro-\nvides funding support for the CBC.\nAt a dinner in the Palace of\nWestminster later that evening, Keith\nVaz, MP, garlanded members of the US\ndelegation and Diane Abbott, MP, made\na welcoming address and presented gifts.\nIn a statement of unity, Bernie Grant,\nMP, as Chair of the Caucus, observed\nthat it was most fitting that the gathering\nshould be taking place in the British Par-\nliament which had once been the home of\ncolonialism.\nThe following day was set aside for a\nconference held at the Commonwealth\nInstitute attended by over a thousand\npeople from all walks of life in Britain's\nBlack community. The day began with a\nBusiness Brunch and was followed by\nfour seminars on education, political de-\ninternational affairs. Whilst time was\nvelopment, economic development and\ninternational affairs. Whilst time was\nlimited, at a final rousing plenary session\nit was concluded that an important start\nhad been made and that more such semi-\nnars needed to be planned for the future.\nThe final event of the weekend was a\nGala Dinner attended by more than a\nthousand people. The Ramsay Lewis\nTrio travelled from the States especially\nto provide the entertainment. At the end\nof the evening, Rep.

            "POINTS OF ORDER:\nHOW TO ORGANISE SEMINARS\nFour seminar sessions were held during the inaugural weekend in April at London's Commonwealth\nInstitute. Headlined \"Agendas for Black Advancement\", they were on International Affairs, Eco-\nnomic Development, Political Development and Education. Most of you who attended enjoyed the\nspace to air strongly-held views and to debate contentious ones. But what about those annoying\nthings you wished you had had time to complain about to the PBC organisers? Well, The Black Par-\nliamentarian has compiled a selection of the most frequently overheard mutterings during the meet-\nings.

            "BLACK BUSINESS\nIN THE UNITED KINGDOM\nby Manny Cotter\nManny Cotter has been instrumental in the creation of hundreds of new businesses in London and the devel-\nopment of minority entrepreneurs. He is currently the Executive Director of the North London Business De-\nvelopment Agency in Finsbury Park, North London. Below, he argues that Britain's minority communities\nmust take advantage of the dramatic and beneficial changes that have taken place in business during the last\nten years.\n(Photo by Humphrey Nemar)\nThe standard of Business Plans and\nPresentations particularly where Enter-\nprise Agency assistance has been sought,\nis at present very high and getting better.\nGreat attention has been focused in this\ndirection owing to the criticisms and rea-\nsons proffered by the banks in the early\neighties, that they were not able to lend\ncomfortably to Minorities, particularly\nBlack people, because their proposals\nwere not being prepared and presented to\na satisfactory standard. Potential entre-\npreneurs from the Black community,\nwith the assistance of Black-led Enter-\nprise Agencies and other supporting pro-\nfessionals in the field of business advice,\nsupport and development, are today pre-\nsenting high quality business plans and\nwell-researched and thought through\nbusiness ideas.\nThe phenomenal success rate of the\nincrease in women-owned businesses\nmust be highlighted. Again and again,\nconsultants have sung the praises of\nwomen clients who show promise of\ncontinued development of their busi-\nnesses despite innumerable difficulties.\nTheir achievements to date promise a\nmagnificent future for generations of\nBlack female entrepreneurs.\nPositive results are identifiable\nthrough the increase in bank lending to\nBlack businesses and also the gradual\nchange in business orientation towards\nmore non-traditional activities.\nWhereas in the past these centred around\nthe provision of personal services, e.g.\nhairdressing, home catering, motor re-\npairs, bespoke tailoring and dressmaking\netc. Today, through the support of Enter-\nprise Agencies and similar organisa-\ntions, the new breed of Black businesses\nnow include those involved in computer\ntechnology, clothing manufacture, light\nengineering, printing and the professions\n- legal, accountancy, etc. Initiatives\naimed at bringing Black business activi-\nties into the mainstream are being devel-\noped by various bodies, and if success-\nful, will open much larger markets for\ngoods and services provided by Black-\nowned businesses.\nOne of the keys to business success in\nany community is training and access to\ninformation. In the past, the Black com-\nmunity had little, or no known access to\ntraining and/or information, which re-\nsulted in the stagnation and/or failure of\nbusinesses already in existence, due to\nmarket saturation and lost opportunities.\nThis situation is rapidly changing\nthrough the emergence of the Black-led\nEnterprise Agencies as well as other sup-\nport services. Many training organisa-\ntions are now managed by professional\nconsultants who have developed their\ntraining to address the needs of Black\nbusiness people.\nCourses are being designed, and\ntraining sessions tailor-made, taking into\nconsideration the time factor. This is to\nenable Black business owners to attend\nwhen convenient so ensuring continuity\nand the benefit of owner-management\nduring trading time and also to minimise\nloss of income during any absence of the\nbusiness owner. It would therefore seem\ninevitable, that through training, the pro-\nvision of expert advice and greater ac-\ncess to and dissemination of information,\nthat belief in the future success of Black\nbusinesses will at least continue to be\nnurtured and encouraged to materialise\nfor future generations.\nThe Black business community must\ncommence the process of collaboration\nand joint ventures both in terms of trade\nand investment. The problem of busi-\nness inhibition and lack of imagination\nas well as the inability to identify oppor-\ntunities remain. The restrictive limits of\nthe Minority market within the UK, as\nwell as the failure to support other Black\nbusinesses through inter-trading, are also\nevident and requires much discussion,\nexchange of ideas and willingness to de-\nvelop and consolidate, and by so doing,\nimprove on current positive trends.\nIn this respect, a great deal can be\nlearnt from our American brothers and\nsisters in terms of the dynamics of busi-\nness and the determination and dedica-\ntion needed to ensure success. Black\nbusinesses in the UK must cease thinking\nat only the parochial level. Black busi-\nnesses must look beyond the boundaries\nof the UK and begin to plan for trading\nwith Europe, Africa, the Caribbean and\nthe Middle East as well as the USA.\nMarkets in the UK are virtually satu-\nrated and the opportunities for the future\nare therefore the larger markets of the\nworld. To this end, an even greater de-\ngree of co-operation between govern-\nment, private sector and the Enterprise\nAgencies working at the grass-roots\nof Black business activities in the com-\nmunity-is necessary to ensure that the\nprogress of the eighties is firmly consoli-\ndated and continued into the next decade.\nLearning the skills to set up in business\nGeneral awareness of the enterprise\nclimate and the opportunities avail-\nable, have encouraged and enabled\npeople from the Black community to\nconsider (a) starting businesses and\n(b) developing the ones they have. Al-\nternatively, they have sought out and\npursued new or additional training for\nmore marketable skills. All this has\nled to a more concentrated effort to-\nwards self sufficiency, business devel-\nopment and economic activities not\nonly for the morale and growing\nwealth of their own communities, but\nalso for the economy of the country as\na whole. Worthy central Government\ninitiatives, coupled with equally well\nmeant local government approaches\nto the causes of an almost total absence\nof Black business activities, have re-\nsulted in a new spirit of individual and\ncommunity worth, where previously, risk of going into business after 20 or 30\nlittle existed.\nyears of settling in the UK.\nWhilst racism in employment has\nchanged very little, the global problem of\nmassive unemployment has exacerbated\neven more acutely, the social conditions\nand environment of the inner city areas in\nwhich largely, the Black and Ethnic Mi-\nnority communities have always settled.\nThe additional social concern of the\ngrowing number of single parent fami-\nlies/women heads of households, unem-\nployment of black males, privatisation,\nredundancies due to relocation, etc., oc-\ncurred in tandem with the promotion of\nthe enterprise culture during the '80s.\nTherefore, it has been the combination of\nall these influences which forced or en-\ncouraged ever-growing numbers of the\nBlack community to take the decision/\nCaptains of Industry in Britain are\nslowly but steadily becoming aware of\nthe fact that Black businesses have much\nto contribute to the wealth of the commu-\nnity and the country.

            "SPORTING TIES\nWITH APARTHEID\nby Sam Ramsamy\nSam Ramsamy of the South Afri-\ncan Non-Racial Olympic Commit-\ntee (SAN-ROC) says the recent re-\ncruitment of British rugby players\nand cricketers to play in South Af-\nrica has once again highlighted\nBritish sports collaboration with\napartheid.\nGroups and individuals campaigning\nagainst apartheid have repeatedly stated\nthat any sports exchange with South Af-\nrica only benefits the privileged white\ncommunity there. It helps fortify the re-\nsolve of the apartheid regime to perpetu-\nate white rule.\nMany British sports administrators\nmerely mouth platitudes against apart-\nheid while covertly providing sanctuary\nfor South African sport.\nThe white South African Cricket Un-\nion (SACU) were able to recruit players\nright under the noses of English cricket\nofficials. Rumours were circulating\nfrom the beginning of the year that South\nAfrica was about to assemble a \"rebel\"\nEnglish team to play in that country. The\nEnglish Test and County Cricket Board\nmade no attempt to verify these rumours.\nInstead, South African officials were\nwelcomed as special guests to their meet-\nings and cricket matches. No objections\nwere made when several officials and\npast cricketers were invited in March to\ncommemorate 100 years of racism in\nSouth African cricket. In fact, the\ngroundwork for the \"rebel\" tour was es-\ntablished then.\nWhen, eventually, the \"rebel\" cricket\nteam to tour South Africa was an-\nnounced, the outrage was drowned by all\ntypes of pretexts justifying the tour. The\ncricketers said that they were going to\nearn a living as professionals, and as free\nindividuals they should be allowed this\nliberty. Their selfish motives allowed\nthem to by-pass the fact that 80 percent of\nSouth Africans do not enjoy this free-\ndom; that the oppressed in South Africa\nwere being, reluctantly, forced to con\nNo S.A. tour for De Freitas\ntribute, by way of taxes, to pay the agents\nof the oppressor.There was talk that they\nwere going to help Black cricket. What a\nblatant lie! Black South Africans made\ntheir objections very clear.\nThey were not wanted in South Af-\nrica. The \"rebel\" cricketers were merely\nacting as agents for apartheid South Af-\nrica to break the international sports boy-\ncott. They were employed as mercenar-\nies to boost the waning morale of South\nAfrica's white electorate. Of course, as\nmercenaries, they were being paid ex-\ntremely well. To such an extent that sev-\neral cricketers found the offer, on purely\nmonetary terms, difficult to refuse. They\nwere being offered fees for just three\nmonths work which they would not be\nable to earn here for ten years. The visits\nby the foreign cricketers and other offi-\ncials who gravitate towards South Africa\nare only made possible by the generosity\nof various sponsors. This is only a cover\nfor a much more complex operation be-\ntween the white South African Cricket\nUnion (SACU) and its government.\nSeveral years ago, SACU urged its\ngovernment to consider providing spe-\ncial tax dispensation for sponsors so that\nlarge sums of money were easily avail-\nable to attract international sports stars to\nSouth Africa. The government now pro-\nvides tax rebates worth 90 percent of\nsponsorship outlay. In other words,\nsponsors only deliver 10 percent of the\nmoney needed for any boycott-breaking\nventure. The other 90 percent is pro-\nvided by the government. On paper gov-\nernment involvement is conveniently\nconcealed by allowing the sponsor to\ntake full credit.\nIn August, a delegation representing\na wide range of South African Black\nopinion visited England to speak with the\n\"rebel\" cricketers. After more than ten\ndays of negotiation, only two, Gatting\nand Emburey, decided to meet with the\ndelegation. They listened but then stated\nthat they are committed to their contracts\nas it was legally binding. But, how did\nthe two Black players, Butcher and\nDeFreitas, who originally signed, con-\ntract themselves out of the tour?\nHere again Gatting, the tour captain,\nwas allowed to go unchallenged when he\npublicly stated that the two Black players\nwere forced to withdraw because of\ndeath threats. DeFreitas admitted that\nhis involvement in the tour had upset\nmany people and \"obviously had its ef-\nfects on me and my family\". Butcher\nalso read out a statement on television\nsaying: \"As a Christian, I believe that all\nmen are the same before God. When I\nagreed to tour I did not realise how\nstrongly my fellow sportsmen would\nfeel. I made a mistake and want to put it\nright\".\nThe complicity of British rugby offi-\ncials in helping to recruit players to com-\nmemorate another racist event - 100\nyears of racist rugby in South Africa - is\neven more outrageous.\nAnti-apartheid activists left no stone\nunturned in making their feelings known.\nThere was concern throughout the\nUnited Kingdom that a visit by British\nrugby players would seriously hinder the\nacceleration of the downfall of apartheid.\nMany top players then announced that\nthey would not be going to South Africa.\nThe tour was on the verge of collapse.\nThen, two officials of the white South\nAfrican Rugby Board (SARB) landed in\nBritain with pocketfuls of money. Sud-\ndenly, we heard the arrival in South Af-\nrica of several players.\nThe official position was that all ne-\ngotiations to invite players had to be con-\nducted through the relevant authorities in\nthe United Kingdom, i.e. through the\nrugby unions of England, Scotland,\nWales and Ireland. But the rugby offi-\ncials refused to reveal the names of those\ninvited.\nIt was earlier announced that officials\nwould not go to South Africa for the\ncommemoration. Even while players\nwere being furtively recruited on a mer-\ncenary basis for what was supposed to be\na lily-white amateur sport, several offi-\ncials seemed seriously concerned. Clive\nGREETING\nRowlands and David East of the Welsh\nRugby Union, both of whom had turned\ndown invitations to go to South Africa,\nwere publicly critical of their colleagues\nwho had accepted invitations. A few\ndays later, Rowlands turns up in South\nAfrica. We wonder what made him\nchange his mind?\nBritish sport generally and the Prime\nMinister in particular, were conspicuous\nby their silence. In France and Australia,\nthere was governmental outcry at South\nAfrican machinations. In Australia, the\nPrime Minister and Foreign Minister\nwere actively involved in dissuading\nmany players from accepting invitations\nto play in South Africa. The President of\nthe Australian Olympic Association,\nKevan Gosper, publicly condemned the\ntour and warned of international reper-\ncussions if Australians were involved in\ngiving apartheid respectability.\nIn this country, many parliamentari-\nans condemned the tour. There were nu-\nmerous requests for the Prime Minister\nto intervene. Even the secretary of the\nEnglish Rugby Union said that they\nwould consider favourably a request\nfrom the Prime Minister. But this was\ngreeted with absolute silence.\nThe chairman of the British Olympic\nAssociation, instead of making attempts\nto intervene to abort the tour, wanted to\nknow why there should be opposition to\nsportspeople going to South Africa when\nthere were no protests at others taking on\nsimilar ventures.\nFinally, a half-hearted attempt by the\nSports Minister was at last made to Eng-\nlish Rugby Union not to pass on invita-\ntions to its rugby players. However, this\nfeeble attempt was completely nullified\nwhen he concluded the appeal by saying:\n\"It is for individual governing bodies to\ndecide whether or not to accept Govern-\nment advice, but I very much hope you\nwill give serious consideration to the po-\nsition outlined in this letter\".\nNo wonder the major part of the invi-\ntation team which has just concluded its\nvisit to South Africa came from the\nUnited Kingdom.\nNoir Greeting Cards congratulates and wishes the Parliamentary Black Caucus and\nthe Caucus Magazine continued success in all its endeavours.\nNior is also pleased to announce to all readers of the Caucus\nMagazine, especially Businesses, Organisations, High Commissions and Embassies,\netc., that we offer a wide range of Multi-Cultural\nChristmas Cards which can be personalised freely, if the order\nexceeds 250 Cards.

He specialises in\ncivil rights cases and was the chair of the\nBroadwater Farm Inquiry. Here, he sum-\nmarises the contents of his report on the find-\nings of the inquiry into racism in Liverpool.\nThe Liverpool 8 Inquiry was the result of\ntwo factors coming together. First, the\nLaw Centre and other Black community\norganisations wanted it. They were fac-\ning a sharpening of police oppression, es-\npecially through the tactic of charging\ncommunity leaders with vague but heavy\n'crimes' such as 'violent disorder'.\nWhile policing was their immediate con-\ncern, historic grievances about racism\nthroughout the city in housing, jobs,\nand education especially-continued to\nbe ignored.\nSo Black organisations supported the\nInquiry, and the key participation in the\nInquiry team of Wally Brown, a leader of\nthe Black community in the early 1980s,\nensured that the report would genuinely\nrepresent Black people's experiences.\nHowever, a report which no-one in\nauthority would heed would serve little\npurpose. The second crucial factor was\nthe readiness of some elements in the\nLiverpool City Council to recognise that\nthe Council itself had to stop being a ma-\njor seat of institutional racism, and start\nto be an agent for obtaining concrete\nbenefits for Black people. So, the Coun-\ncil was prepared to finance the Inquiry,\nand there are signs that the Council will\nact on its recommendations.\nThe report includes a history of ra-\ncism and resistance in Liverpool over\ntwo centuries. Black people have been\nsettling in the city since slavery days, and\nthe patterns of racism have hardly\nchanged. James Watkins, an American\nex-slave, wrote in 1850 of the \"leprosy of\nracial hatred\" which he found in Britain.\nCharles Dickens in 1861 described how\nBlacks in Liverpool were \"liable to\nslights in the neighbouring streets\". Af-\nrican seamen, who were considered\n\"more amenable to discipline\", were\npaid a lower wage than their white\nequivalents. And in 1919, white rioters,\nin numbers up to 10,000, attacked Black\npeople in the streets and lodging-houses\nof the city.\nYet there was continuing resistance,\nand achievements by Liverpool Black\npeople which are too little known. The\nParliamentary Black Caucus should sa-\nlute the memory of John Archer, who in\n1913 in Battersea became Britain's first\nBlack mayor, and went on to be the first\nPresident of the African Progress Union\nand election agent for Shapurji Saklat-\nvala, Britain's first Black MP (for\nLabour in 1922-23 and for the Commu-\nnist Party in 1924-29). Another achiever\nwas George Christian, who founded a\nbusiness empire in West Africa from his\nLiverpool head office in the early years\nof this century.\nComing up to date, the report docu-\nments the facts of racism today. That\nwhile Liverpool has a Black population\nof at least 6%, only 1.6% of Council em-\nployees are Black. That in a head count\nof 1000 counter staff in the City Centre\nstores, only 15 Black faces were seen.\nThat in school, Black children face daily\nracial abuse with little or no support from\nteachers. That in housing, Black families\nare driven out of white areas and pushed\nback into Liverpool 8, whether they want\nit or not. That in jobs, overt discrimina-\ntion has been connived at by the Trade\nUnion movement through their right to\nnominate their members to fill job va-\ncancies. That in sport, Black footballers\nand other sportspeople face abuse and at-\ntack from the touchline.\nAll this and more led the Inquiry to\nthe conclusion that racism in Liverpool is\n\"uniquely horrific\". Nowhere else is\nthere such open abuse, such a devastating\nlack of mobility.\nOn the policing side, the report con-\nfirmed that many Black people had been\nfalsely charged with \"violent disorder\";\nthe efforts of London lawyers, Black and\nwhite, had secured acquittals in every\ncase. And there were even more disturb-\ning findings. Behind a facade of \"com-\nmunity policing\", there is a hard-line pol-\nicy, involving constant patrols by squads\nin protected vehicles, and an apparent ne-\nglect of the hard drug traffic which is\nthreatening to send Liverpool 8 into an\neven worse decline.\nThe evidence of David Scott, a for-\nmer community policeman, married to a\nLiverpool Black woman, confirmed\nwhat many on the street were saying: that\nracism in the police is rife at all levels;\nthat false evidence is given by police of-\nficers in court; and that hard information\nabout drug traffickers has been ignored.\nHe said:\n\"The Force policy in general was\nthat anything was better than a public or-\nder confrontation in Liverpool 8, and\ntherefore hard drugs would be allowed\nin, the communitywould be left to 'dope\nitself up\"\".\nBecause of the seriousness of this\nevidence, and the non-co-operation of\nthe Merseyside Police in the Inquiry, we\nhave called on the Home Secretary to in-\nstitute an official Inquiry into policing in\nToxteth. This must be supported. So\nmust David Scott and his wife, who on\nthe very night before the report's publi-\ncation, were arrested and charged with\noffences allegedly committed last year.\nThey are strongly protesting their inno-\ncence.\nThe Inquiry's report made a series of\ndetailed recommendations, to the Coun-\ncil, the private sector employers, the\nGovernment, the EEC, the Police\nAuthority, the Chief Constable, etc. We\nhave asked to stay in being as an Inquiry\nteam for a further two years, to monitor\nthe recommendations which we have\nmade.\nSome first steps have been taken; for\nexample, the Council has set up a Posi-\ntive Action Training Scheme to qualify\n600 Black youth for Council jobs, ad-\nministrative and technical. But far more\npressure is needed at a national level, to\nremedy the terrible injustices which ra-\ncism has caused.\nThe report's title, Loosen the Shack-\nles, was deliberately chosen. The shack-\nles of historic oppression still tie down\nthe descendants of Liverpool's slaves\nand seamen. The recommendations of a\nreport cannot break those shackles -\nonly the actions of the people themselves\ncan do that. By exposing and shaming\nthe authorities responsible for Liver-\npool's racism, the impact of a report can\nloosen the shackles, create more space\nfor oppressed people to claim their right-\nful place. It is a weapon in the struggle\nwhich continues.\nLoosen the Shackles, the First Re-\nport of the Liverpool 8 Inquiry, is pub-\nlished by Karia Press, 41 Rheola Close,\nLondon N17 9TR, price £8.75 including\np& p.\nThe Black Parliamentarian - 35 -",

What they really\nmean is that, in practice, the judges and magistrates fail to recognise their own prejudices.\nThere is now overwhelming evi-\ndence to show that Black people are less\nthan equal before the law. To understand\nwhy this should be the case, one has to\nexamine the historical background.\nPrior to the 13th century, the experi-\nence of Black people in Britain had been\none of being treated as different but\nequal. With the advent of slavery, a new\nphilosophy had to be found to justify the\npractice; racism was therefore formu-\nlated and developed for this purpose.\nThe Elizabethan community of 20,000\nBlack Londoners was prevented from\nworking in most trades and professions\nand pushed to the margins of society.\nProperty rights of English slaveowners\nwere sanctioned by English judges until\nthe abolition of slavery in 1833. The\nsame philosophy was used to \"civilise\" a\nheathen world of \"black\", \"brown\" and\n\"yellow\" peoples.\nThe English legal system was used to\njustify and administer British colonial-\nism and imposed an alien law and custom\non many different peoples. During the\nearly part of this century, the native sons\nand daughters of Empire could work and\nfight when required for the mother coun-\ntry but were not thought fit to decide their\nown destiny.\nThe legal system has been used fre-\nquently to contain and undermine genu-\nine Black protest. The whole plethora of\nracist immigration laws through the no-\ntorious \"sus\" laws and the present abuse\nof the Public Order Act legislation, have\nbeen used to deny fundamental civil\nrights to Black people.\nSince the first Black barrister quali-\nfied in England in 1850, Black lawyers\nhave faced discrimination and bigotry\nfrom their white colleagues. It is no\nsmall wonder therefore that if white law-\nyers fail to respect their Black col-\nleagues, it is more than likely that they\ndiscriminate against their Black clients.\nJudges are still recruited overwhelm-\ningly from the Bar (notwithstanding the\nGreen Paper proposals) and are over-\nwhelmingly white, male and middle-\nclass. How then do these individuals\nsuddenly shed all the prejudices present\nin society or the Bar itself?\nSENTENCING POLICY\nOne of the reasons for the critical po-\nsition of Black people within the Crimi-\nnal Justice System is the enthusiastic use\nof custody as a solution to crime. As\nBlack defendants fall at the end of the\nscale in respect of this treatment, one can\nonly achieve a real cure by reforming the\nwhole system.\nCompared to the rest of Europe, we\nnow have the undistinguished honour of\nsentencing more people to custody than\nany other country both proportionally\nand in total figures. During 1985, some\n25,000 custodial sentences were passed\non Black people far more than the\nnumber of Blacks who passed through\nhigher education. In 1985, 160,000 cus-\ntodial sentences were passed in England\nand Wales compared to 90,000 in West\nGermany and France. That is despite the\nfact that we do not have a higher crime\nrate.\n—\nOn June 30th 1987, 50,270 people\nwere in custody. 48,510 male and 1,760\nfemale. The four principles of sentenc-\ning are supposedly punishment, deter-\nrence, retribution and rehabilitation.\nHowever, since the late 1970s, there has\nbeen an abandonment of the principle of\nrehabilitation and a concentration on the\nother three. Average sentences for the\nsame offence are longer now than they\nwere ten years ago. There is no evidence\nto suggest that the increase in the length\nof sentences has had any effect whatso-\never on reducing the crime rate. The one\narea which strongly suggests the path to\nbe followed is in the area of juvenile sen-\ntencing. The widespread use of interme-\ndiate treatment schemes has reduced cus-\ntodial sentences from nearly 8,000 in\n1981 to 4,000 in 1987. The same imagi-\nnation and flexibility of response has not\nextended any further. There is a strong\ncase to suggest that people who receive a\nnon-custodial sentence are less likely to\nre-offend within the next two years.\nRecently, the Home Secretary stated\nthat it was not for him, the Government\nor the House of Commons to lay down to\nthe courts how many people they send to\nprison...\"it is our job to provide the\nplaces\". At the cost of £252 per week per\nprisoner and £69,000 per new cell built,\nthis laissez-faire attitude is a costly and\nineffective sanction. Both West Ger-\nmany and Holland have substantially re-\nduced their prison populations in recent\nyears.\nIt is clear that we need to see a dra-\nmatic decrease in the use of custody both\nin frequency and length for all defen-\ndants. Black defendants would benefit\nfrom the implementation of a more sci-\nentific approach to sentencing (as re-\ncently suggested by the Lord Chancellor)\nbut also of a more liberal or flexible atti-\ntude by the judiciary. Without such fun-\ndamental change, it will be of question-\nable value achieving full equality of\ntreatment for Black people within a sys-\ntem that is inherently defective.\nRACIAL DISPARITY IN\nSENTENCING\nThe extent to which Black people are\nprocessed through the Criminal Justice\nSystem is now well documented. On the\n30th June 1987, there were 50,270 peo-\nple in prisons in England and Wales. 14\npercent or 7,050 of the prisoners were\nfrom the ethnic minorities. There has\nbeen a steady increase since 1985 when\nthe Home Office showed the proportion\nof Black prisoners to be 12.5 percent.\nAlarmingly, this proportion increases to\n27 percent in respect of Black female\nThe Black Parliamentarian - 37-",
            "prisoners. Only 5 percent of the general\npopulation in England and Wales belong\nto an ethnic minority. Furthermore, 9.5\npercent of the prisoners in 1987 were\nAfro-Caribbean, who represent only 1-2\npercent of the general population. There\nhave now been many ad hoc studies done\non the extent of discrimination within the\nCriminal Justice System. However, it is\nperceived by many that after years of re-\nsearch this is still seen as a substitute for\ndirect action to eradicate racism.\nIn July 1987, in response to a letter\nfrom the Home Office, the Government\naccepted that there was racial discrimi-\nnation within the Criminal Justice Sys-\ntem. The Lord Chancellor's Office en-\ndorsed the fact in subsequent correspon-\ndence and confirmed that they were\n\"committed\" to its eradication. How\never, there have been only minimal steps\ntaken to make that major policy state-\nment a reality. On the information we\nhave, it seems that most members of the\njudiciary and magistrates regard the ex-\nplanation as being simply that Black peo-\nple commit more crime. This may be\ncouched sometimes in liberalistic terms\nas due to our deprived economic back-\nground. This explanation fits neatly with\nsociety's stereotypical view of Black\npeople as dishonest, liars, violent and\npeople generally to be feared.\nThe evidence, however, suggests that\nthis is not the case but that Black people\nare disproportionately fed into a system\nwhere racism plays a negative role at\neach stage. Comparisons with the Black\npopulations of Australia, United States,\nNew Zealand, South Africa and West\nGermany, show a parallel pattern to the\nUnited Kingdom.\nRESEARCH\nA study by the Policy Studies Insti-\ntute in 1983 found that Black youths\nwere four times as likely to be stopped\nand searched as their white counterparts.\nThe number of Afro-Caribbean people\narrested accounted for 17 percent of the\nLondon total but for only 5 percent of the\nactual population. A study conducted by\nthe London Borough of Hackney in\n1986, concluded that young Black peo-\nple were more likely to be convicted in\ncourt and twice as likely to be jailed as\nwhites. Young Black people are also\nover-represented amongst those sen-\ntenced to 12 months or more youth cus-\ntody under Section 53 of the 1933 Chil-\ndren Act.\nResearch in 1984 concluded that the\nlikelihood of victims reporting crimes to\n-38 The Black Parliamentarian\nthe police was affected by the perceived\nethnic origin of the perpetrator. All the\nindications show that there is a deteriora-\ntion in the justice available for Black\npeople. There is consequently a widely-\nheld belief by Black defendants that un-\nlike their white counterparts, they are\nguilty until proven innocent.\nFurther research by the South East\nLondon Probation Service found that in\n1985, 29 percent of youth custody sen-\ntences were passed on Afro-Caribbean\nyouths compared to their constituting\nyouths compared to their constituting\nonly 4.7 percent of the total population.\nIn particular, Black defendants sen-\ntenced to youth custody were less likely\nto have been previously offered supervi-\nsion or probation, and came from more\nstable backgrounds, i.e. they were less\nlikely to have been in care, and more\nlikely to be still living at home.\nA survey by the West Yorkshire Pro-\nbation Service, called \"Sentencing, Race\n& Social Enquiry Reports\", examined all\nSocial Enquiry Reports prepared from\nApril to July 1987 for Leeds Crown\nCourt and Bradford Magistrates' Court.\nOf the whites in the survey, 32 percent\nreceived immediate custodial sentences\ncompared to 45 percent for Asians and 44\npercent for Afro-Caribbeans. The report\nsays: \"The trend in sentencing is un-\ndoubtedly to the disadvantage of the\ndoubtedly to the disadvantage of the\nBlack offenders and this cannot be justi-\nfied in terms of their offences or personal\ncircumstances\". Its effect is that more\nBlack people find themselves in prison\nthan whites who have committed the\nsame type of offences, and who are likely\nto have worse criminal records.\nThe most comprehensive informa-\ntion on the numbers of Black people in\ncustody stems from the Home Office\npublication in 1986, \"The Ethnic Origin\nof Prisoners\". Black defendants were\nagain found likely to have fewer previ-\nous convictions than their white counter-\nparts. For males sentenced to custody\naged over 21, 38 percent of whites were\nknown to have had 11 or more previous\nconvictions compared to 22 percent of\nAfro-Caribbean and 8 percent of Asians.\nSimilar variations in custody patterns\nwere equally marked for the offences of\nwounding, burglary, robbery, theft and\nwounding, burglary, robbery, theft and\ndrugs offences.\nAnother survey commissioned by the\nHome Office entitled \"The Court Dis-\nposal of Young Males\" by Monica\nposal of Young Males\" by Monica\nWalker, confirmed these trends when\npublished in 1988. Based on offenders\naged 14 to 16 and those then sentenced in\nthe Crown Court, more Black juveniles\nwere sentenced more harshly than their\nwhite counterparts.\nThe disparity pervades each and\nevery aspect of the sentencing process.\nThe Home Office Statistics for June\n1987 show that for adult males, Black\npeople accounted for 18.5 percent of\nthose sentenced to over 4 years compared\nwith 9 percent of those sentenced up to\n18 months. Among sentenced young of-\nfenders, Black defendants account for 17\npercent of youth custody trainees sen-\ntenced to 18 months, compared to 9.5\npercent for both the shorter sentences\nand detention centre option.\nThe amount of research now com-\npleted is sufficient for the Government\nto take effective action to redress the im-\nbalance.\nTHE PROBATION SERVICE\nThe probation service although\nahead of the judiciary in accepting some\nawareness of its own racism, is still a\nlong way from putting its own house in\norder. The failure of the probation serv-\nice to even deal fairly with its own Black\nofficers gives an indication of its inabil-\nity, at present, to deal fairly with Black\nclients. Only 1.9 percent of probation of-\nficers are Black, (i.e. 127 out of a total of\n6,651) with none at Chief Officer level\nand only three at senior probation officer\nlevel.\nOnly very rarely do Social Enquiry\nReports highlight the racial discrimina-\ntion faced by Black defendants in terms\nof job, housing etc., and never do they\ncaution against racism within the Crimi-\nnal Justice System. In general terms,\nthere is a tendency to describe white of-\nfenders in pathological terms with be-\nhaviour stemming from personal weak-\nness. Black offenders, however, were\ndescribed in terms of capabilities with\nthe offending stemming from rational\ndecisions.\nBAIL\nThe discrimination which pervades\nthe rest of the system is clearly apparent\nin the implementation of the Bail Act\n1976. The basic presumption in favour\nof bail has been eroded over the years and\nin relation to Black defendants, the exis-\ntence of a wide discretion has been a\nlicence to discriminate. The Home Of-\nfice Statistical Bulletin 6/89 shows that\nmale Afro-Caribbean defendants at 9\npercent are almost twice as likely to be\nremanded in custody awaiting trial;\nAsians 8 percent and whites 5 percent.\nThe position was similar for females.\nThis is consistent with the fact that 31\npercent of all those received on remand\nfrom London courts were Black.\nEven more alarming is the fact that a\nhigher proportion of Black defendants\nwere subsequently acquitted than white\ndefendants. These records are for indi-\nviduals with similar backgrounds, com-\nmunity ties and for the same sort of of-\nfences and antecedents. Given the pre-\nsumption of innocence, this would sug-\ngest that Black people were twice as\nlikely to have been wrongly remanded in\ncustody.\nThe Bail Act as it is presently applied\nis unquestionably being used to deny lib-\nerty to innocent Black people and for\nmany others who, after conviction, re-\nceive a non-custodial option notwith-\nstanding the period spent in custody.\nJUDICIAL RACISM\nThis heading is, for most members of\nthe establishment, a contradiction in\nterms. For most white members of the\njudiciary and magistracy, racism is some\nform of extreme behaviour associated\nwith the very vivid imageries of Nazi\nGermany, of the Soweto and Uiterhage\nmassacres in South Africa or the extrem-\nism of the National Front. This identifi-\ncation with \"extreme\" racism means that\nthey themselves fail to understand that\nthey too can discriminate.\nThe day to day racist stereotypes\nwhich help to explain the disparities\nwithin the Criminal Justice System\ntherefore pass them by. These judges\nand magistrates are not necessarily \"bad\"\npeople but are the otherwise fair, honest,\nsometimes Christian people who have\nlittle or no realisation of their true views\nof Black people. This failure to under-\nstand their own shortcomings is com-\npounded by the education process, media\nand the system itself in which they oper-\nate. There is widespread ignorance of\nBlack history and of our social and eco-\nnomic contribution to this country.\nThese attitudes surface from time to time\ninto public with the publicity given to\nracist remarks but these examples are\njust the tip of the iceberg.\nWhen Sir James Miskin Q.C., the Re-\ncorder of London, referred recently to\nWest Indians as \"nig-nogs\" what was the\nthinking and attitudes underlying the re-\nmark? His explanation served only to re-\ninforce the lack of self-awareness: \"Both\nthe victim and the accused were West In-\ndians. I did not refer to the accused who\nwas convicted of murder as a \"nig-nog\",\nthat reference to the victim simply\nslipped out and was not in any way in-\ntended to have any racist significance\".\nThe comments speak for themselves.\nSuch remarks are not, however, isolated\nincidents as sentences have on occasion\nbeen reduced due to allegedly racist re-\nmarks (an appeal from a sentence of\nJudge Finney recently). Judge Potter in\nBirmingham commented that an Asian\ndefendant ought to be able to speak\ndefendant ought to be able to speak\nproper English after so many years work-\n-\ning here a problem which the British\nin India and Africa failed to take to heart.\nLegal applications can now be made\nit seems to have a judge stand down if\ncounsel \"has reasonable grounds to be-\nlieve a tribunal is biased\". The form for\nthis application is detailed in a letter from\nJustice Steyn (the former chair of the Bar\nRace Relations Committee) to the Com-\nmission for Racial Equality dated 22nd\nSeptember 1988. Such legal applications\nare obviously a way of combating such\novert racism as Black lawyers have\nfound in the UK.\nIn the USA, in The State of Georgia\nvs William Anthony Brooks (1988), an\napplication was made to remove Judge\nJohn Land due to alleged racism dating\nback to 1954. This problem of judicial\nbias can be particularly acute when one is\napplying to challenge the racial composi-\ntion of the jury. In February 1989, an ap-\nplication was made for Judge Prosser to\nstand down in the case of R v Hicks &\nothers at Cardiff Crown Court. This was\nbecause, inter alia, Judge Prosser had\nbeen known to state that: \"Cardiff has a\nlarge Black population - going back\nover 150 years, it having been a very\nbusy coal and steel exporting port: they\nare integrated citizens-not a breath of\ncolour problems has been felt in Car-\ndiff\". The application was dismissed but\nthe Judge was put on the defensive to the\nextent that the Rastafarian client ob-\ntained a fair trial.\nThe Council for Legal Education has\nrecognised the need to have a training\nprogramme that prepares barristers for a\nmulti-racial society and the need to\nrecognise and deal with their own ra-\ncism; our judiciary receives no such in-\nstruction. The Bar Council, from whose\nranks the judiciary come, have for anum-\nber of years recognised the widespread\neffect of racial discrimination within its\nranks. The Judges Council and its mem-\nbers have not, it seems, felt the need to\nput their house in order.\nIn a recent ruling of the High Court\npresided over by Lord Justice Watkins\nVC, the Chief Constable of Avon &\nSomerset was found to have been correct\nin refusing to admit solicitors' clerks to\nsee defendants in police custody. It was\nstated in the judgement that the police\nwould be entitled to exclude someone if\nthey \"know or believe that the person is\nmerely a colourable pretence of a clerk\".\n\"There may be circumstances where the\npolice know that he is criminally orien-\ntated if unsullied by detention\". The four\n'outdoor' clerks in question were Black.\nThe Lord Chancellor is drawing up a\ncode of practice for magistrates in their\ntraining. There clearly needs to be a re-\neducation of the judiciary if they are to\nacknowledge the unreality of the 'colour\nblind' theory. The reality has been and\ncontinues to be something completely\ndifferent for Black people as we suffer\nunder a system of \"Black rules and white\njustice\".\nREFORMS TO\nSENTENCING\nThe Society of Black Lawyers would\npropose a number of reforms to include:-\n1. The establishment of a sentencing\ncouncil to involve all the relevant profes-\nsional groups including the judiciary.\n2. The statutory abolition of custody\nform any minor offences.\n3. Systematic ethnic monitoring of\nall sentencing decisions on a court by\ncourt basis.\n4. Regular training for the judiciary\non the need to use the alternatives to cus-\ntody available.\n5. The statutory alternative of de-\ntoxification and community service as a\ndirect alternative to convicted drug ad-\ndicts and alcoholics for sentences of less\nthan 5 years, where the addiction is the\nprime motive for the crime.\n6. The availability of community\nservice orders as a direct alternative for\nnon-payment of fines. Custody to be im-\nposed only if the community service or-\nder is then breached.\n7. Re-drafting of the Bail Act to en-\nshrine the right of bail and to make that\nabsolute in relation to certain summary\noffences.\n8. The introduction of the 110 day\ntime limit as practised in Scotland.\nThe Black Parliamentarian - 39-",

This, the Society of Black\nLawyers would say, is worse than burn-\ning money, as for many people, incar-\nceration only increases the likelihood of\na return to crime, prison and more expen-\nditure. Despite all the expenditure, there\nis no return on the investment; by the end\nof the century, at least 8,000 cells will\nstill be without sanitation.\nIt seems even the right-wing Centre\nfor Policy Studies is proposing an inde-\npendent sentencing council which would\nset guidelines on sentencing and estab-\nlish principles for courts to adopt. This is\na measure the Society has advocated for\nsome time but it is absolutely essential\nthat the Government deals with the ra-\n(g) The full implementation of anti- cism inherent in the system. An inde-\nCustody must genuinely be used as\nthe last and not the first resort. There\nmust also be greater emphasis on re-\neducation for those in custody as op-\nposed to a 23-hour lock up regime.\nEvents such as the riots at Ridley Re-\nmand Centre will occur with greater fre-\nquency unless urgent action is taken.\nThe degree of maturity achieved by a\nsociety is marked in part by the degree of\nunderstanding and flexibility it shows to\nthose who have broken its rules. It is\nhigh time in this country that we\nachieved that degree of maturity.\nEquality of treatment before the law\nis a fundamental human right which is at\npresent being denied to Black people in\nBritain. A democracy, however, does\nnot in itself guarantee that freedom with-\nout commitment from those in authority.\nIf the racism which pervades the Crimi-\nnal Justice System is allowed to continue\nunchecked, we will all suffer in the years\nto come.\n* The Society of Black Lawyers was created by lawyers of African and Asian descent in the late 1970's to further the inter-\nests of Black people in the legal profession and in the country generally.\nNew Perspectives Ltd.\nCLASSIC FRAMED PRINTS\nBlack Fine Art Specialists\n484 West Green Road, London N15 3DA\nTelephone: 889 9348\n-40- The Black Parliamentarian\nCarlos Allen\nPHOTOGRAPHIC STUDIO\nART GALLERY\n5, Wordsworth Parade,\nOpposite 677 Green Lanes,\nLondon N8 OSJ\nComplete Wedding Service\nEngagements, Photographs, Gowns, Videos\nCakes, Cars, Catering, Stationery, etc\nAlso over 12 inexpensive and high quality\nproducts/services including:\nPortraits, Christenings, Banquets,\nPicture Framing, Photo-Albums,\nPaintings, Greeting Cards, Mirrors,\nExhibitions, Silk Shirts,\nExclusive Ladies and Children's Wear etc\nHours of opening:\n10.00am - 6.00pm Mondays/Saturdays\n1.00pm - 5.00pm Sundays\nTel: 881 9494\nBLACK\n_ NATIONAL\nCAUCUS\nOF\n1977\n-\nSTATE\nLEGISLATORS\nTHE NATIONAL BLACK CAUCUS\nOF STATE LEGISLATORS\n206 Hall of the States Building, 444 N.

            "TOTTENHAM LABOUR PARTY\nMP'S REPORT\nA.\n1.\nHOUSE OF COMMONS\nLONDON SW1A OAA,\nPARLIAMENTARY FEEDBACK\nVAUXHALL BY-ELECTION\nHAY 1989\nThe Labour Party NEC acted in my view, in a very undemocratic\nin imposing\na\nmanner\ncandidate on the Vauxhall party. The original NEC\nshortlist didn't contain the majority of those nominated by the wards,\nincluding Martha Osamor, Linda Bellos, Marc Wadsworth and Russell\nProffitt. I was particularly concerned that they did not select\nof these and gave various spurious reasons for their non-selection.\nany\nin\nThese included in the case of Martha that she was too \"simple\",\nthe case of Russell that he worked for Brent Council and the papers\nwould use that against him. Another reason was that by-elections\nnational events and the person selected must be able to represent\nParty nationally. A number of questions arise immediately.\nare\nthe\nof\nIs a worker for any organisation now responsible for the policies\nthat organisation and not the owners or elected members? Are we to\nhave a two tier system of selection with desirables now able to stand\nin by-elections and undesirables only able to stand in general\nof\nand\nelections? Will we now see an \"A\" team of white only by-election\ncandidates and maybe a few token blacks who have no chance\nselection because of lack of experience, and a \"B\" team of blacks\nothers who won't be able to compete? What does the NEC now mean by\nbeing able to represent the Party nationally? Are they talking about\na whites-only Labour Party? ( I noticed that the recent full page\nadvertisement in the Guardian heralding the Policy Reviews didn't have\nany non-white people in it.) Is this the new face of the Labour Party?\n2. EUROPE\nThe Tories appear to have finally begun to tear themselves apart over\nEurope and we must capitalise on this in the coming European elections\nby working all out for a victory by Pauline Green. We should use the\nEuro-elections to demonstrate Thatcher's unpopularity and in doing\nsow even greater divisions in the Tory ranks. It is growing more and\nmore clear that Thatcher is out of tune with the rest of Europe in\nwanting the EEC to be a purely ecomonic institution, with no concern\nfor social well being, and we should not hesitate to push this\nmessage home.\n3. ECONOMY\nThe rows are beginning to surface in the Tory party over monetary\npolicy. Mrs Thatcher, because of lack of support for her position,\nhas been forced to bring back Prof Alan Walters to boost up her\nflagging monetarist position in the light of attacks by Geoffrey Howe\nand the Chancellor, especially on the question of monetary union\nwithin Europe. Mrs T recently blamed the Chancellor for the rise in\ninflation. She was subsequently forced to apologise to him for her\nremarks. Inflation is again on the move despite a slowing down in",
            "HOUSE OF COMMONS\nLONDON SW1A 0AA\ncredit and \"better\" monetary control. Petrol price rises, lack of\nlocal authority funding from the Govt resulting in large rate\nand higher than inflation wage settlements (eg the power\nworkers) All this is contributing to a call from the city for even\nhigher interest rates as a way of checking inflation. Together with\nthese worries, house values in the South-East are falling rapidly,\nby some 10% in\nrecent weeks. These will give the Govt severe\nheadaches, and cause many of their newly won supporters to think\nagain.\n4. NAMIBIA\nthe\nI spoke in the House of Commons on the current situation in Namibia on\nApril 13th and clearly the South Africans are continuing their\nrepressive policies. The main target of South Africa is the Namibian\npeople's organisation SWAPO who face an immense financial task in\nUN monitored election campaign which runs from July to November 1989.\nSWAPO has to provide for the return of thousands of refugees as well\nas financing its own election campaign to compete against the massive\nApartheid supported parties and alliances.\nThe Anti-Apartheid Movement have set up a SWAPO Election Campaign\nAppeal.

This record will be released in the Summer and\nwill raise money for the struggle against Apartheid.\n5. POLICY REVIEW\nI have not yet received a copy of this document, but from what I have\nread in the press, I feel that we shall have an uphill struggle to\nsell the policies contained in the review to the electorate.\n6. HEALTH\nThe strength of opposition to the White Paper continues to concern\nmany Tory backbenchers with marginal seats, as well as not so marginal\nones. The key opposition at the moment is coming from the medical\nprofession, and Kenneth Clarke's much publicised agreement with them\nis proving somewhat farcical, as their campaign against the White\nPaper is continuing unabated. I think it is very clear that the public\nsimply does not believe the lies which the Government is putting out\nabout the purpose of the White Paper, and Kenneth faces an enormous\nhiccup in his personal rise to political stardom.\nAs if\nhealth\nto convince us all of their commitment to publicly provided\ncare, the government yesterday announced the appointment of\nnumber of\nof infamous industrial axemen to run it. Rover Cars asset-\nstripper Graham Day, and British Steel union basher Sir Robert Scholey\nwill join Sainsbury's supremo Sir Roy Griffiths and British Aerospace\nboss Sir Kenneth Durham on the new NHS policy board. These are all\npeople who have built their reputation by privatising the public",

Needless to say no space can be found on the board for\na nursing representative !\n7. TRANSPORT\nThere have been some interesting developments lately on this front\nlately, culminating in the recent announcement that the Government\nis\ndevote £6,000 million to road building in the next few years, to\nfinance a major motorway building programme. It is also to encourage\nthe development of so called Toll Roads.

CONSTITUENCY MATTERS\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nI would like to thank the Party and all the many individual nenbers\nwho sent messages of condolence on the death of my mother on the 22nd\nApril. On behalf of my family, I thank you all, and especially for the\nfloral tribute which was sent to her funeral fron the Party. Your\nkindness\nand that of the community generally, has been a great\nconsolation to us through a very difficult period.\n1. POLICE ATTACKS ON THE BLACK COMMUNITY\nAs members may have read in the press, the situation as regards the\nrelationship between the Police and the black community in Tottenham\nhas taken a serious turn for the worse in recent weeks, and I have\nfelt it\nnecessary to speak out strongly on this. The number and\nseriousness of the cases which have come to my attention have left me\nwith little option. The invasion of the homes of three black families,\nby large numbers of Police with dogs, for no reason, involving\nunnecessary violence and racial abuse, followed by the charging of\nmembers of the families who tried to defend themselves,\nis totally\nunacceptable, and must be seen\nof\nand must be seen in the context of a rise in the number\nincidents reported to me and other agencies of the harassment of\nblack people in Tottenham.",

PUBLIC WORKS REDUNDANCIES\nI was approached by local workers whose jobs are threatened who\nconcerned that residence in the borough seemed to be an irrelevant\nconsideration in the selection for redundancy. I wrote to Public Works\nto enquire as to whether this was true, and found this to be the case.\nI really do think that this is to be deplored.

            "BACKGROUND\nThe\nBlack\nInternational\nConstruction\nOrganisation (BICO) is a UK based voluntary\norganisation which has emerged out of the desire\nof black professionals to assist in articulating the\ndevelopment agenda of particular groups both in\nthe UK, and internationally. We aim to contribute\npositively to the development work that is already\nunderway in inner city areas in the UK, and in\nAfrican, Caribbean, and Pacific countries by\nworking in partnership with governments, the\nprivate sector, community-based organisations,\nand individuals with a special emphasis on\ndisadvantaged groups.\nHISTORY\nIn March 1995 a group of Black professionals\nfrom the construction industry in the UK launched\na paper entitled Building E = Quality.\nQuality. At the\nlaunch a specialist group articulated the need to\nextend this theme towards the United Kingdom's\nInternational Development Programme.\nI+H\n玺\nMISSION STATEMENT\nTHE WIN-WIN PHILOSOPHY'\nTo facilitate the creation of an ethical enabling\nenvironment that will foster the design of\nsustainable systems and processes in all aspects\nof provision for the built environment, with a\nview to creating an equitable stakeholdership in\nhumanity.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nE\nAIMS and OBJECTIVES\n*\nTo create a platform that will assist\ndebate on pertinent issues that affectprovision for\nthe built environment globally, with an emphasis\nonAfrican Caribbean and\nand Pacific (ACP)\ncountries.\n*\n-\nTo positively encourage the participation\nof women in all relative spheres in the process of\nprovision for the built environment.\n*\n30\n*\nUnstoppable world urbanisation is now a reality.\nThe planet's urban population is expected to\ndouble in the next twenty years. In 1990 only\n15% of the 6.1 billion strong human race lived in\nurban areas. By the year 2030 city dwellers will\nmake up 66% of the population. 90% of this\nmassive growth will occur in the developing\nworld.\nIt is in fulfilment of this need, and in highlighting\nthe very important dimension of culture in social\nas well economic development that BICO will\nplay a role.\nWe propose to do this by adopting the two\nconcepts of the 'EVOLUTIVE ETHOS', and the\nconcept of ' THE WIN-WIN PHILOSOPHY'\n\"To fail to plan is to plan to fail\" \"\nTo provide training and\ncapacity\nbuilding, consultancy services, organise seminars\n, lectures, exhibitions and workshops, that reflect\nthe dimension of culture.\nTo act as facilitators and enablers to\nCommunity Based Organisations (CBO) and Non\nGovernmental Organisations (NGO) in African\nCaribbean and Pacific countries, under the Lome\nonvention with a view to creating a greater\nnse of stakeholdership and awareness of\nSustainable development.\n*\nTo publish, edit and collect a database of\ninformation for provision for the built\nenvironment in the ACP countries including\ncataloguing and archiving of Urban/Rural space\nincluding built form in these regions.\nTo assist other Charity Organisations\nincluding bi-lateral and multi lateral agencies in\ntheir development agenda.\nthe\nTo be the first point of contact for, and\nnational authority on, sustainable\ndevelopment in developing countries\n*\nTo represent the interest of black\nprofessionals in the built environment in all\nsections of industry, commerce, the arts and\neducation, irrespective ofprofessional discipline."

They have natural links with their countries of origin\nencompassing language, culture and informal networks, and, by encouraging such\ncommunities to generate and sustain trade with their 'home' regions, he felt that\neconomic activity could be created for the benefit of all. Bernie successfully\nharnessed the necessary support from agencies such as the North London Training\nand Enterprise Council and the Upper Lee Valley Partnership, and launched the\nunique Centre in September 1997.\nThe GTC adopts a holistic approach in helping start-ups and businesses, which are\nsupported through the entire process of setting up operations, sourcing products and\nmarkets to completing transactions. Its aim is to see small and medium sized\nenterprises gain a share of the market to which they currently have no access.\n-\nThe GTC, however, is more than simply a national trade promotion and business\ndevelopment agency. Beyond local economic regeneration, the Centre seeks to help\neconomically poor countries particularly in the African, Caribbean and Pacific\nregions, to diversify and broaden their trade relations with the UK and the rest of the\nworld. Its approach is to achieve sustainable economic development based on\nmutual fair trade, rather than aid. In addition to the promotion of trade, this area of\nthe Centre's activities embodies capacity-building work with both public and private\nSectors.\nUnder Bernie's Chairmanship which lasted until his death, the GTC established a\nbranch in South London with the support of the LB Lewisham enabling it to help\nlarge numbers of small businesses and start-ups in south London as well as north\nLondon. The Centre's activities included undertaking a number of trade missions on\nbehalf of its UK clients and hosting several meetings, trade seminars and network\nevents involving Embassies, High Commissions and Ministers from Overseas. More\nrecently, the GTC has begun working on development and capacity-building\nprogrammes in the Eastern Caribbean and similar initiatives with a number of\nAfrican countries are at the exploration stage.\nThe Global Trade Centre\ngenerating and supporting trade\nbetween the UK, Africa and the Caribbean\nFor further information, please telephone: 020 8376 5222\n(Fax: 020 8376 1010; or e-mail gtc@globaltrade.co.uk)",

For these average\nwhites react to our call for black demands.\nby simply and honestly ie affirming \"WHITE\nPOWER\". Their immediate concern is not\ncivil rights (which are after all only the\ncommon rights which should be guaranteed\nby everyone by the state and it laws),\nbut with power.\nThey recognize instinctively that once the\nissue of power is raised, it means one set\nof people who are powerless replacing\nanother set of people who have power.\nIt is something that we must make or take\nfrom those in power.\nMany Trade Unior officials and members\nconsider themselves politically aware.\nI believe that some of the founders of\npolitical theory had they been alive\nthey would have no problems facing the\ncontradictions which have developed,\nотоп\nsince their original analysis.\nI consider it the responsibility of the\nTrade Union and Labour movement to\nadvance these theories to meet today's\nhistorical situation in which black people\nare raising their demands within the British\nTrade Union meovement..\nMost black and white workers are still\nusing the slogans \"Black and White\nUnite and Fight\", Despite the slavish\nallegiance to the concept of Black and\nWhite had common issues and grievances.\nThis seems an evasion of the scientific\nquestion of which workers they are\ncalling on, as it reinforces the average\nwhite workers to cling to white power and\nbring out quilt in the white liberals.\nTo us in B.T.U.S.M. it is quite clear\nthat most white workers in Britain are\nlike the petty bourgeoisie of MARX'S\ntime and they collaborate with the power\nstructure and support the system because\ntheir high standard of living depends on\nthe continual oppression of black people\nthrough the power structure of our society.\nThey find it quite natural to exh. rt blacks.\nto intergrate into white society and the\nwhite power structure but cannot conceive\nof it's being the other way around.\nThe Trade Union Labour Movement is no\nexception to the process of large organis-\nations advancing through the exploitation\nof the disadvantaged and deprived people\nin our society..\nA.

All\nof these 5 White NALGO officials are totally\nincapable of functioning in a Race Committee\nas they do not have an adequate grasp of Blac\nissues.\nA lunch time lobby was arranged by the Black\nWorkers group in NALGO, at the Old Ship Hotel\nin Brighton which was attended by over 150\ndelegates. At this lobby Liverpool was\nrequested to withdraw their motion, failing\nwhich to call for precedence, so that the\nEaling motion could be heard first.\nONE SIDED DEBATE\nhot\nveq\nAt the conference precedence was denied and\nthe Liverpool motion was passed with the full\nweight of the NEC behind it. Next came the\nEaling motion.

WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR THE\nTHREE SPEAKERS TO REPLY ON BEHALF OF THE\nEALING MOTION THE DEBATE WAS CUT SHORT, AND\nALL THE SPEAKERS WERE PREVENTED FROM\nSPEAKING BY A REQUEST THAT THE MOTION BE PUT\nTO CONFERENCE FOR VOTING.\nNALGO CONFERENCE 14-1\nTHE NEC CHEATS!\n5.\nTo the surprise of the Black NALGO workers\nsitting in the visitors' gallery, overlooking\nthe whole of the conference, and others, it\nseemed from the show of hands that the Ealing\nmotion had won.\nThe Black workers witnessing the chairperson's\ndeliberate falsification of votes demanded\nthat a count should be taken by card vote.\nThis was supported by well over half of the\nconference delegates who stood up. (A\nminimum of 50 standing delegates required a\ncard vote to be taken.)\n185\nIn spite of this the chairperson refused.\nEnraged at the racism and blatant dishonesty\nof the NEC, Black NALGO workers protested by co\na slow hand clap. The NEC ignored this and\nattempted to gloss over the race issue, and\nturned to the next item on the agenda.\nThe chairperson of the NEC promptly declared\nthe conference closed, as it had been\n'invaded by non-delegates'.\nThe Black workers then proceeded down the\ncentre of the conference floor in single\nfile, whilst angry white delegates, shocked\nby the incident, who had hitherto been the\nfirst to declare themselves non racist,\nhurled abuse such as, \"GIVE THOSE BLOODY\nBLACKS AN INCH AND THEY TAKE A MILE\",\n\"GO BACK WHERE YOU COME FROM\",\n\"GO TO HELL\", etc.\nne\nSell\nBAS\nBTUSM Conference\n27th 28 Nov\nWorking\n885\nWITH\nINTERNATIONAL\nBLACK SPEAKERS\nထာ\n883\nထာ\nГо\nexed IIow\nThe protest had dropped the guard, behind cos\nwhich lay years of racist conditioning.\nedw\nbds\nFUTURE ACTION\n883\nထာ\n883\n883\n883\n885\nFURTHER DETAILS TO BE\nANNOUNCED\nBlack Brothers and Sisters in jubilant\nmood outside the Brighton Conference\nCentre.\not nj\nn] to smo\nPhoto by J.

The present Tory\nGovernment is now reaping the benefits of\nTUC's lack of courage in not going the whole\nway.\nTUC's lack of conviction in tackling estab-\nlishment's opposition to secondary picketting,\nclosed shop, etc., has given Tebbit and his\nkind the platform to tighten the noose round\nTrade Unions.\nGrunwick's History\n2 on odd of\nIn the\nGrunwick is a perfect example of exploitation\nof Black workers by racist employers.\nmail order and photographic processing\nsections of the firm 99% of the workforce\nwere Asian. Taking advantage of racism in\nemployment which prevents Black workers from\nfinding any form of work, the management\nselectively recruited Asian workers, they\nthen quite ruthlessly proceeded to exploit\nworkers. Compulsory overtime from 7.30 a.m.\nto 10.30 at night was commonplace. Working\nconditions were appalling, one toilet between\n200 workers, pregnant women told they could\nnot go to clinics during weekdays (knowing\nfull well there were no clinics at weekends).\nNew employees were sacked on the spot if they\nasked for sick leave. Grunwick, a Dickensian\nworkplace thriving on racism of the 20th\ncentury, management blatantly contravening\nrights of employees and standards of working\nconditions stipulated in the Employment Acts,\nknowing that a racist White society and a\nnon-unionised workforce would not challenge.\nGradually the management stepped up the\npressure on the workers. A league table was\nintroduced of people processing number of\nfilms each week. This competitiveness\namongst workers increased productivity for\nthe management whilst workers began to feel\nmore insecure as people in the lowest\nposition in the table were threatened with\ndismissal.\nThen one day enough was enough, Mrs Jayaben\nDesai and her son Sunil walked out after\nbeing threatened by management when she\nrefused to do any overtime. She joined\nfive other workers who were sacked earlier\nin the day because they protested at being\nabused by the management.\n3.\nThe Union\nThe seven workers led by Mrs Desai con-\nvinced others to join in the struggle and\nformed a strike-committee. On the advice\nof the local Citizens Advice Bureau the\nstrikers chose APEX as their Union\n(Association of Professional Executive and\nClerical Staff). Half the workforce did not\njoin APEX for the fear of losing their jobs.\nPickets\n4.\nAPEX was not recognised as a legitimate\nunion by the management led by George Ward.\nThe workers then started picketting Grunwick.\nThis was proving to be quite successful,\neffectively cutting the turnover by half.\nAfter unsuccessfully trying negotiations with\nthe management APEX appealed to the machinery\nof the Labour movement to paralyse Grunwick.\nFor three days the Postal Workers supported\nthe strike and stopped Grunwick's mail.d\n2900\nHowever, Tom Jackson the Post Office Union\nLeader got cold feet when he was threatened\nby George Ward (Grunwick's boss) with Court\nAction with the help of the National\nAssociation of Freedom, a Tory right-wing\nFascist Group.\nto\nThe Sell Out\nAfter two years of intense struggle, with\nvictory in sight Black people led by Mrs\nDesai were sold out.

In hospitals, as nurses and other\nsupernumary grades. These were the jobs the\nwhite people did not want. Most of these\njobs were the life line of those who came,\ntrying to better their lot and influence of\ntheir destiny. The Trade Union movement in\nall or most of these work areas either\ncanvassed membership, or membership of the\nTrade Union was a condition of employment.\nIt soon became clear that racial discrim-\nination was an evil that the black workforce\nhad to overcome. Groups of white liberals\nhaving a twitch of conscience mobilised with\nthe blacks to press Governments for changes.\nThese changes are manifest in the succession\nof Race Relations legislation.\nDuring this time, people in work places were\nfacing blatant discrimination either being\npractised or by policy interpretation. Many\nstories have been told which showed that the\nTrade Union movement ducked the issue of\nracial discrimination in the workplace.\nWords from the Trade Union like 'personality\nclash', 'shop floor banter' were used to\nsmooth over the problems. In some cases the\nwhite Trade Union shop stewards with their\ncommittees refused to train black operatives\nso that they could not be graded higher.\nOnly in the battle for supremacy among\nvbs\nCertainly in large work places the Trade\nUnions have looked after wages and conditions\nin the interests of all workers. They see\nthis as their primary role, but fail to\nunderstand that conditions which are\nnegotiated for a multi-racial workforce\nneed to reflect the needs of the black\ngroups within it.\nThere has been the industrial machinery which\nlooked at grievances of the workforce but\nnone have to date been able to come to a\ndecision that discrimination occurred where\nsuch complaints are made. Many of these wo\ncases were considered by the old Race\nRelations Board. It had a higher success\nrate than the work place industrial machinery\nAttention was drawn to this by members of the\nold Race Relations Board Conciliation\nCommittee who at that time pointed out this\nfailure.\nHaving considered the inherent problems that\nexist within a society that treats the\ndifferent Unions did some of these cases come majority of black workers as people without\nto light. This occurred at Standard\nTelephone Company.\nWe can look back 25 years and see the\nstruggles in which black members of the\nTrade Union movement participated, and yet it\nis only very recently that there are any\nblacks in some key positions within the Union\nstructure. The TUC only recently published a\nBlack Workers Equal Opportunities Charter.\nIt's a step forward but there is very little\npressure from within the Trade Union movement\nto ensure the contents of the Charter are\nimplemented. Yes, agreements have been\nnegotiated but implementation is virtually\nnon existent. The local Trade Unions seem\nreluctant to make sure positive action is\ntaken by those with whom agreements are made\nto eradicate discrimination.\nambition the Black Trade Unionist Solidarity\nMovement has arrived.\nThis organisation intends to work within\nthe existing TUC structure to fight for\nchanges and assist those black trade unionist\nwho are suffering from the results of the\ninability of the Trade Union movement to meet\ntheir needs.\nWhen one begins to analyse the situation the\nonly conclusion at which one arrives is that\nthe Trade Union movement has failed its black\nmembers.\nBy Sam Springer\nHood\nzoqque bas\nBTUSM Members organised a Disco and Food Night, to recruit\nmembers and raise funds,\nMOAJ8\nThe Social was held at Haringey Trade Union Centre and raised\n£89.00.\n000000000000000\nThe Black Trade Unionists Solidarity Movement has been\nin operation since December '81, when a group of Black\nWorkers came together to begin a united movement of all\nBlack people in Britain, to pressurize the existing\ninstitutions, and fight for our rights.\nIf you are of Asian, African or Carribean descent,\nemployed/unemployed, send for an application form and\njoin the BTUSM,\nPlease send me\n(number) application form(s).\nNAME (INDIVIDUAL ORGANISATION)\nADDRESS\nPost slip to: Neville Adams, 115 Neville Road, N16.",

There have been several attempts in the past to organise a\nblack CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT but all have failed because of splits, person-\nality clashes and lack of discipline and organisation.\nThe economic crisis has meant that black people are being hit hardest at\nwork through redundancy, non filling of vacancies and deliberate acts of\nracism. The trade union movement continues to pass well-meaning resol-\nutions but these have no effect on racism at work and in the trade union\nmovement. It is now time for black trade unionists to step forward and\norganise within the trade union movement.\nWe have another historic task to perform. We have learnt discipline and\norganisation from being in the trade union movement and have a duty to\nlead the other sections of the black community into organising a CIVIL\nRIGHTS MOVEMENT. At a recent conference of black lawyers, they made plans\nto set up a black lawyers organisation to defend blacks and to fight for\nblack equality. They are determined to assist us legally and to set up\na CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. We have other black sections like Cultural,\nEducational, Medical, Political etc., which will be organised in due\ncourse. Our job as black trade unionists is to organise these sections into\nthe CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT our people need. Our job will be difficult but\nas trade unionists we are accustomed to pressure.\nBill Morris, National Organiser TGWU, and I attended the Black workers\nConference in Birmingham on Saturday 12th September. Apart from the\nBlack People's Day of Action on 2nd March, I have never been inspired\nas much from any other event in Britain. This was a historic conference\nas it brought together over 100 black trade union activists, including\ndelegations from British Leyland Longbridge and the Indian Workers Assn\n(GB). The conference unanimously agreed to set up a National Black\nTrade Unionists Organisation. At the same time a conference of black\nlawyers was being held in Surrey. At that conference, the top American\nLawyers who built the American Civil Rights Movement and worked with\nMartin Luther King, explained the black American experience\nand gave\ninvaluable advice on setting up a Civil Rights Movement in Britain.\nThe American brothers and the British lawyers all agreed unanimously\nthat black trade unionists were only people who could set up the Civil\nRights Movement because of our organisational and disciplined approach.\nWe can't let our people down.\np.t.o.",
            "contd....\nThis letter is the first stage in setting up a Steering Committee of Black\nTrade Unionists Solidarity Movement and ultimately a CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.\nWe are setting up a London Steering Committee of the BTUSM and are asking\nyou to attend the first meeting of this Committee.

It blinds\nthe\nunions to racism among\ntheir own members.\n\"They have this noble idea\nthat we're all brothers and sis.\nters, 'Workers of the World\nUnite' and all that, and for\nthem to admit that this is not\nreally how it works in practice\nis an admission of their own\nfailure at a very basic level,\"\nsaid Mr. Grant.\nThe Black Trade Union Solid-\narity Movement was born in the\naftermath of the 1981\nsummer\nviolence in Brixton, Southall\nand Toxteth. It grew from the\ntrade unions' \"negative\nsponse\" to these riots and was\nnurtured by two national con-\nferences one of black wor\nre-\nkers in Birmingham and the\nother of black civil rights law-\nyers.\nFull-time\nMr. Grant, who is a full-time\nofficial with the National Union\nof Public Employees in London,\nand deputy leader of Haringey\nBorough Council, addressed both\nmeetings.\n\"As far as I was concerned,\"\nhe said, \"the riots brought a\nlot of racism to the surface\nwithin the trade unions.

They are schooled in\nhistorical distortions reinforced\nby the media. Many of them just\ncan't help being racist,\" said Mr.\nGrant.\nHe said the BTUSM stressed\nthe importance of taking posi-\ntive steps to counter this racism\nwith such things like racial\nawareness courses or employing\nspecialists to overhaul union rule\nbooks and expunge discrimin-\natary practices.\nTrade union branches with a\nlarge Asian membership should\nseriously consider employing in-\nterpreters to translate meeting\nprocedures.\nbe\nPub meetings ought to\nstopped if Asian members felt\noffended by being on licensed\nof\npremises. The recruitment\nunion officers should also be in-\nvestigated particularly internal\nadvertising of posts.\nIf unions are white dominated,\ninternal advertising of top posts\nwill only perpetuate this. Blacks\nwill only come in at the bottom\nrungs.\nMr. Grant labelled the pre-\nentry closed-shop trade unions\nas racist and urged the unions to\nlook closely at how they opera-\nted. \"It is no coincidence that\nthere are very few blacks in\nhighly skilled Fleet Street print\njobs,\" he said.\nHolidays\nWhen he was organising hos-\npital workers in West Lon-\ndon, Mr. Grant said an at-\ntempt was made to negotiate\ndifferent holidays. for Asian\nworkers.\n\"The management was a bit\nput out because on certain feast\ndays, like Ramadam and Diwali,\npeople would not turn up for\nwork. What we tried to do was\nexchange the holidays.\n\"Asian workers were quite\nhappy to come in on Christmas\nDay and other Christian holi-\ndays so long as they could have\ntheir feast days off.\"\nMr. Grant said some work-\nBLACK VICTIMS: Sacked black workers on the picket line outside the Heathfield\nfactory, Slough, are confronted by police as a Securicor van tries to push its way\nthrough.

The trouble\nis, they don't do that.\"\nMr. Grant said black workers\noften find it difficult getting\nwhite workers to support them.\nin any action they decide to take.\nHe said it was also hard for\nblack workers to get unions to\ntake up immigration cases on\nbehalf of members and to fight\nfor black promotions on the shop\nfloor.\n\"Instead of recognising the ex-\ntent of racism on the shop floor,\nthe unions shove the blame on\nto the management for creating\ndivisions on racist lines.

This act of\ntreachery by Black countries is particularly repugnant in view of the racist\npolicies of the United States of America.\nWe also condemn these 6 Black countries for reneging on the agreement of the\nCaricom countries that there should be no military intervention in Grenada.\nThese countries were party to this agreement but went behind the backs of the\nCaricom countries to conclude a dirty deal with the USA.\nWe believe that these countries have been panicked by the success of the\nGrenadian Revolution in providing basic rights like free education,\nhealthcare and employment to its citizens. At the same time, they have\nconsistently denied these rights to their own citizens whilst corruption in\nall these Governments is widespread, encouraged by the USA and the\nmultinational companies.\nWe believe that this act of betrayal of Black People will not be forgotten\nand we call on citizens of these 6 countries to take steps to remove their\nHeads of Government.\nWe also condemn the Thatcher Government for complicity in United States\nracism and imperialism in invading a small Black country. We note that this\nGovernment failed to heed the clear warnings of the invasion just as it\nfailed to heed the warnings of the French intention to prevent Black Britons\nfrom entering France. We believe that the British Government allowed the\ninvasion to proceed on the basis that a puppet quisling Government would be\ninstalled in Grenada to do the bidding of the USA and Britain.\nWe believe that the invasion by the USA follows the American Government's\npolicies of denying Blacks their rights in the USA. It is also clear,\nhowever, that America intends to try and dominate all the non-white peoples\nof the world as well as those peoples who have rejected Capitalism. Grenada\nhas proven that the revolutionary ideas of 110,000 people could shake to its\nvery roots a nation of 200 million people to such an extent, that it was\nforced to abandon any pretence of morality or legality and resort to the use\nof naked force and brutality against the revolutionary ideas of the People's\nRevolutionary Government under Maurice Bishop.\n30\n12T Trade Union leaders Vince Noel and Fitzroy Bain, and the other ordinary\nWe further condemn those responsible for the execution of Prime Minister\nMaurice Bishop, Ministers Jacqueline Creft, Unison Whiteman, Larry Bain,\nTM3\nGrenadian citizens who sought to free their Leader.\nWe believe that these executioners will be dealt with in due course but their\natrocities must not be allowed to cloud the issue of the invasion of a\nsovereign state.\nWe mourn the loss of Cuban and Grenadian lives in their heroic struggle\nagainst enormous odds and congratulate the people of revolutionary Cuba for\ntheir support in building the revolution. We believe that no amount of guns\nwill destroy the gains of the revolution and that the revolutionary struggle\nwill continue in Grenada.\nWe reaffirm that the peoples of Grenada, Cuba, Nicaragua, El Salvador,\nSurinam and the other countries in the Caribbean, Central and South America\nand the rest of world have an absolute right to self-determination without\nthe intervention of the USA.\nWe believe that Black people in particular should learn the lessons of\nGrenada so as to turn this tragic episode of our history into one which\nunites all Black people throughout the world.",
