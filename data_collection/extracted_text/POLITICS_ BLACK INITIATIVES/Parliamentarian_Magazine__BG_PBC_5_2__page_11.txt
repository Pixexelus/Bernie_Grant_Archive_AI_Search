FREEDOM FOR NAMIBIA
by Sean O'Donovan
One of the most inspiring developments in Southern Africa is the continuing victories of the people of Namibia
over apartheid. But Sean O'Donovan writes that the situation is still fraught with great difficulty and danger,
and that our solidarity is still vital.
As a result of the liberation
struggle under the leadership of
Namibia's national liberation
movement, SWAPO, the South Af-
rican government was finally
forced to agree to the implementa-
tion of the UN plan for the inde-
pendence of Namibia.
SOLIDARITY
WITH
SWAPO!
SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma in London
The creation of a sovereign and inde-
pendent state of Namibia, joining the
ranks of the Front Line States, will repre-
sent a profound advance in the struggle to
free Africa of apartheid, racism and colo-
nialism.

The South African Government
did not agree to the UN Plan because
of a fundamental change of objec-
tives in Southern Africa, but rather
tives in Southern Africa, but rather
because of the combination of the in-
ternal struggle and South Africa's
military defeats in Southern Angola.
military defeats in Southern Angola.
Those defeats were in part due to the
international arms embargo, and in
part due to other sanctions which
made it increasingly unable to meet
the financial burden of its illegal ad-
ministration and occupation forces.
The clear lesson is that if partial
sanctions were partially effective
over Namibia then total mandatory
sanctions would therefore be totally.
effective and will lead to the total
elimination of apartheid.
The long drawn out process of ne-
gotiations began in May 1988 in
London with the meeting between
South Africa, the USA, Angola and
Cuba. SWAPO, crucially, were not
included. Talks led to an agreement
signed on December 22nd 1988, and
April 1st was set as the commence-
ment of the implementation of the
UN Plan. The election period starting
in July 1989 leads to Constituent As-
sembly elections in November. The
party, or group of parties, that re-
ceives at least two-thirds of the votes
of the 670,000 electorate will then be
mandated to write the Constitution of
a new Namibia. It is anticipated that
independence would then be secured
after a further five months.
However, it soon became clear
that the preparations would be seri-
ously hampered by a critical deci-
sion taken in the UN. That was the re-
duction from 7,500 to 4,650 in the
number of UN Transitional Assis-
tance Group (UNTAG) to be sent to
Namibia during the transition to in-
dependence. As a direct result of the
cutbacks in the military component,
there was no effective UN presence
in much of Namibia on April 1st. The
UN also failed to force South Africa
to disband its para-military terror
squads known as Koevoet (Crow-
bar). Instead Koevoet were merely
transferred to the regime's police
force (SWAPOL).
On April 1st, SWAPO forces
came in from the bush to surrender
their arms to UN forces. They were
met instead by the heavily armed
South African forces, including
Koevoet, who committed acts of car-
nage against Namibian civilians as
well as SWAPO combatants.
In a House of Commons debate
on 13th April, Bernie Grant MP, who
is an Executive Committee member
of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, re-
minded the House that he first raised
the matter of UNTAG deployment at
Prime Minister's Question Time on
31st January 1989. Britain, as one of
the five permanent members of the
UN Security Council, has a primary
responsibility to ensure the success
of the UN Plan and could have in-
sisted that the original number of
UNTAG troops be maintained. In-
stead Mrs Thatcher further aggra-
vated the situation by her unfounded
allegation that SWAPO was guilty of
a serious challenge to the authority of
the UN. In his speech Bernie Grant
asked:
"Why did she seem to get every-
thing wrong? Why was she so eager
to accept the South African position?
Did she not read - as I did - the report
of the UN's representative in Na-
mibia, which said that SWAPO did
not have any hostile intent? Did she
not think, 'Maybe I can give them
the benefit of the doubt?' Certainly
not. I suggest to the House that the
Prime Minister is, indeed, a friend of
the racists and that she cannot stand
the idea of Namibian independence.
That is the fact of the matter
SWAPO President, Sam Nujoma,
said in August 1989, that the pros-
pects for free and fair elections still "
hangs in the balance". Nearly all the
Namibian media is owned by South
African sympathisers who faithfully
promote the Democratic Turnhalle
Alliance (DTA), SWAPO's main ri-
vals in the elections. The media, par-
ticularly radio, is being used within
Namibia to smear and distort
SWAPO's election campaign. The
British media is not much better, as
they invariably repeat unchallenged
the South African Government's re-
port of any incident. South Africa is
still in effective control of Namibia,
and evidence is emerging of terror
tactics being used to intimidate any-
one prepared to support SWAPO.
Many of SWAPO's leaders and ac-
tivists have been imprisoned or oth-
erwise harassed.
It is clear that SWAPO command
widespread support among the vast
majority of Namibian people. For in-
stance the emerging trade union
movement, united in the National
Union of Namibian Workers
(NUNW), has declared its full en-
dorsement of SWAPO. The theme of
NUNW's recent congress was: Vote
for SWAPO, Vote for Freedom,
Vote for Education, Vote for Peace.
Students, youth and women's or-
ganisations are all openly supporting
SWAPO.
However, this support will not be
translated into votes unless SWAPO
are given financial help to match the
money made available to anti-
