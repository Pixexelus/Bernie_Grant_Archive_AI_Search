Hattersley
clashes with
Grant on
black section
By Richard Evans, Political Correspondent
The Labour Party was heading
for another bitter dispute over
black sections last night as Mr
Roy Hattersley virtually
ordered Mr Bernie Grant to
keep out of Birmingham this
week.
Mr Grant, the Haringey
council leader and Labour
parliamentary candidate, is
due, together with Miss Linda
Bellos, leader of Lambeth
council, to be among leading
black politicians attending a
public rally in Birmingham
tomorrow. It will see the
"illegal" launch of a black
section in the Birmingham
Labour Party.
Labour's National Exec-
utive Committee ruled re-
cently that there was no need
for a separate section in the
party for black people and
added that party members
faced expulsion if they became
involved.
The Birmingham rally is
believed to be the first of
several to be held nationwide
to set up black sections in
towns and cities.
Mr Neil Kinnock is being
urged strongly by Labour MPs
to intervene by publicly
repudiating those involved
and warning of the dangers to
party unity.
The proposal by Mr Grant
and Miss Bellos to visit Bir-
mingham has infuriated most
of the city's Labour MPs and
five of them, headed by Mr
Hattersley, have written in the
strongest terms to the two
council leaders.

Hattersley
tomorrow's rally as "a meet-
ing organized by a small,
unrepresentative group of
people who claim to be con-
cerned about the problems of
some ethnic communities
within our city".
They add: "As Labour MPs
in Birmingham, fully commit-
ted to racial equality and
ending
discrimination,
we
want to make it clear that
neither Birmingham District
Labour Party nor the city
council needs any advice from
you or Haringey and Lambeth
councils.
"Indeed, we would have
thought that you had more
than enough to do in your own
area in countering the ravages
of Conservative cuts in the
money which can be spent by
councils on the vital services
on which so many people need
to rely.
"But if you do have spare
time, you should come to
Birmingham to learn how a
sensible and progressive coun-
cil the largest Labour-led
council in Britain - is dealing
with this problem instead of
coming to give us the doubtful
benefit of your advice."
The Birmingham Labour
MPs say in a press release on
the two council leaders' visit:
"We don't want you".
Mr Simon Hinds, a spokes-
man for Birmingham black
sections, said that the decision
to hold a rally had not been
taken to defy Labour's NEC
deliberately.
"We believe encouraging
black people to get involved in
this society's political struc-
tures is more important than
taking note of dictatorial and
undemocratic rulings created
without black people's
consent.
"The black section is here to
ensure a vital need for the
black community to get in-
volved in politics. We need
links with the black commu-
nity to make us more account-
able and representative and
thus more effective", he said.
The chairman of the Bir-
mingham black sections will
be Mr Amir Khan, who was
only recently readmitted to
the Labour Party. He was one
of three members expelled
from Mr Hattersley's
Sparkbrook constituency in an
earlier dispute over black
sections.
