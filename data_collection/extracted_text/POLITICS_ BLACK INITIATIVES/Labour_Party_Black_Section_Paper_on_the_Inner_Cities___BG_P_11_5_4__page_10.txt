Access to new tenancies for Black people will become more difficult
due to discrimination by racial landlords.
As Housing Associations become less dependent on local authorities
due to private financing, it will be more difficult for councils to
nominate Black people to housing Associations where the rents may be
too high.
The Housing Act makes no reference to homelessness where Black
people are over-represented.
The Black Section has recently produced policy papers on Education
(1988), Policing (1987), Immigration (1987), Employment (1987),
Racial Harassment (1986) and therefore these subjects are not
included in this paper. This does not mean that these topics are
not important in the lives of Black people in the inner cities, on
the contrary, these topics are of (considerably) more importance to
Black people and therefore merited early work on developing ideas
and policies.
