BLACK SECTIONS RESPONSE TO THE ELECTION RESULT.
Historic triumph for us all. Black People of Asian and African descent
throughtout Britain will rejoice that a Collective Black Socialist voice
will now be heard in Parliament.
We take great heart from the defeat of Peter Brunivel in Leicester East,
who proved himself to be No Friend of Black People. Keith Vaz now
carries the mantle of the last Black MP, Shapurji Saklatvala, who served
as a Member of Parliament for Battersea until 1929.
What was clear throughtout the country was that where Confident Black
electorate existed The Labour Party won.
This was not the case in Nottingham East where a candidate had been
imposed against the wishes of Black and white Party Members. The Labour
loss is a blow which will be felt most severely by Black People.
The divisiveness of Thatcher and her Government has been demonstrated by
the General Election result a great gap now exists between the Have
and Have Not's
Black people and white people, Women and Men, Young and Old, WE will
continue to campaign for a Labour victory.
END.
