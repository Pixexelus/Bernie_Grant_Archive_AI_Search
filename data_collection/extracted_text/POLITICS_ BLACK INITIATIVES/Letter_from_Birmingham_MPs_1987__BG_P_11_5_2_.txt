Ir. Grant.
We understand that you are coming to Birmingham on Tuesday
7 April to attend a meeting organised by a small, unrepresenta-
tive group of people who claim to be concerned about the
problems of some ethnic communities within our city.
As Labour MPs in Birmingham, fully committed to racial equality
and ending discrimination, we want to make it clear that
neither Birmingham District Labour Party nor the city council
needs any advice from you or Haringey and Lambeth councils.
Indeed, we would have thought that you had more than enough
to do in your own area in countering the ravages of Conservative
cuts in the money which can be spent by councils on the vital
services on which so many people need to rely.
-
But if you do have spare time, you should come to Birmingham
to learn how a sensible and progressive council the largest
Labour-led council in Britain is dealing with this problem
instead of coming to give us the doubtful benefit of your
advice.
yous singel.
