Bernie Grant welcomed Julian Hunte on behalf of the Caucus and
invited him to give a presentation on the effects of the Single
European Act on the economies of the Windward Islands.
Julian Hunte outlined the background to his tour and presented
letters from the leaders of the opposition parties in Dominica
and St. Vincent indicating that he spoke on their behalf. He
tabled a document detailing the history of trade in bananas from
the Windward Islands to Europe. He identified the foremost
concerns as being:
1)
2)
That despite approaches from his party and its counterparts
in St Vincent and Dominica, the respective Governments of these
islands were not prepared to deal with these crucial issues on a
bipartisan basis.
That, given the dependence of the Windward Islands on banana
exports (which currently constitute 90% of exports from St
Lucia), the Single European Act could, if implemented
without due regard to the concerns of the Caribbean, bring
disastrous consequences. For example, an unemployment rate of
40% was projected.
