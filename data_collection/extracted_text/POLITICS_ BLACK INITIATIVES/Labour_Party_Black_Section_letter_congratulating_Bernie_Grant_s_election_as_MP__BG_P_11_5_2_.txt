Dear
Bernie,
The
We would like to congratulate you on your magnificent win last Thursday.
election of a Black member of parliament in Britain will give heart to our
struggle, both in Britain and else where in the Black world. The arrival
of a collective Black socialist presence in the House of Commons, is
something that we have together being fighting for over the past four years,
and we look forward to building on this success in the coming months and
years.
We have no doubt that your election will encourage Black people to join
the party, and progress our struggle for an autonomous Black voice
campaigning for race equality through out the party. Do get in touch
when you feel we can be of some help.
We will continue to keep you informed of our activities, and look forward
to seeing you at future meetings.
Yours in the struggle,
Kingsley Roon
Kingsley Abrams.
