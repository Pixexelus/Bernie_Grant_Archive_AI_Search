PRESS RELEASE FROM PARLIAMENTARY BLACK CAUCUS
ikely
15.6.88
SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE PARLIAMENTARY BLACK CAUCUS, BERNIE GRANT
M. P. TODAY EXPRESSED DEEP CONCERN ABOUT THIS WEEK'S N. A. C. R.O. REPORT.
HE HAS PUT DOWN A PARLIAMENTARY QUESTION TO THE HOME SECRETARY DOUGLAS
HURD.
MR GRANT COMMENTED:
" THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY BLACK PEOPLE IN BRITISH PRISONS. THIS IS NOT
BECAUSE THEY COMMIT MORE CRIMES THAN ANYONE ELSE, BUT BECAUSE, AS MANY
OF US HAVE KNOWN FOR YEARS, THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE GIVEN A
SENTENCE AS OPPOSED TO ANY OTHER FORM OF PUNISHMENT. "
PRISON
THIS REPORT PROVES WHAT WE ALWAYS SUSPECTED THAT THERE IS SERIOUS
RACISM IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN BRITAIN. IF YOU ARE WHITE
YOU WILL PROBABLY GET A FINE OR SUSPENDED SENTENCE WHEREAS IF YOU
wwww
THIS IS
ARE BLACK YOU WILL BE LOCKED UP FOR THE SAME OFFENCE.
ESPECIALLY THE CASE IF YOU ARE YOUNG, AND THIS EVIDENCE CONFIRMS WHAT
YOUNG BLACK PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY HAVE TOLD ME."
"
NOW
NO-ONE IS SAYING THAT CRIME SHOULD GO UNPUNISHED
MUST BE ASKED AS TO WHY IT IS FELT THAT BLACK PEOPLE SHOULD
PUNISHED MORE HEAVILY THAN WHITE PEOPLE WHEN THEY COMMIT A CRIME"
-
- BUT QUESTIONS
BE
cks
"1
IT IS TIME THAT THE GOVERNMENT DID SOMETHING TO PUT A STOP TO
THIS. THE HOME SECRETARY CANNOT QUIBBLE WITH THE EVIDENCE IN THIS
REPORT, AND I HOPE THAT IN HIS REPLY TO MY QUESTION HE WILL STATE
QUITE CATEGORICALLY WHAT STEPS HE INTENDS TO TAKE. "
