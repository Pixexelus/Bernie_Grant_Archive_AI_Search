A number of discussion papers have been prepared by women on various aspects
of the need for a new women's organisation and the issues it should address.
Extracts from two of these appear below-
A New Kind of

Closures has a vision with some of her
sisters of a Union for Women, open to all
women, to challenge the male dominated,
workplace-based trade union movement. She
says:

remained largely the domain of women.
When children arrive, that responsibility
mainly remains with the mother, even if
she has another job. In today's world,
because of women's long struggle to gain
equality, there is a slight change of
emphasis and a token amount of sharing

at work or at home to significantly change
the status of women. Women are still used

Black Women & the

member and sponsor of WOMEN FOR SOCIALISM,

Parliamentary Candidate by the NEC because
of alleged remarks about racism and the
Labour Party.
She says:
Historically women have taken a back seat
both in Labour Party politics and the
Trade Union Movement as a whole.
Black women suffer particularly because it
is generally felt that their aspirations
and political demands will be met by the
organisations which campaign for Black
Rights, i. e. Black Sections or the much
discredited Black and Asian Committee.
However, a major problem has been the fact
that Women's Sections in the Labour Party
in particular have in most cases failed to
attract in sufficient numbers Black

but we must ensure that future strategies
take into account Black women's demands.
Black women care and
fight. If we examine
revolutionary movements around the world
against imperialism and colonialism, we
will know that Black women have fought
alongside their
male counterparts.
Therefore the notion that Black women are
not political is frankly an indictment on
the way that the Labour Movement has
failed to attract the active participation
of their Black sisters.
