PARLIAMENTARY BLACK CAUCUS DEFENDS THE LONDON SCHOOL OF
ECONOMIC'S STUDENT UNION
The Parliamentary Black Caucus today came to the defence of
London School of Economic's students, who are being attacked by
the media and by Conservative MP's for choosing Winston Silcott
as their Honorary President.
Mr Silcott is serving a prison sentence for his involvement in
the death of PC Blakelock, in the Broad-Water Farm incidents.
A Parliamentary Black Caucus Spokesperson said today: "Nobody
supports killing, and nobody supports the killing of policemen.
The London School of Economic's students have selected Winston
Silcott as their Honorary President, because they believe that
he is not guilty and that a grave injustice took place, many
international organisations including Amnesty support this
view. The students have been badly misrepresented."
