THE VOICE OF BLACK BRITAIN
'Not arson'
flare-up
By BEVERLEY TREASURE
A RACIST arson attack is being ignored by the police al-
though the schoolchildren involved have admitted to it.
The victim, referred to as Mrs X because she wishes her
name to be withheld, said that a week ago a group of boys
set fire to her front garden, burning plants and causing
damage.
"Luckily my next door neighbour was at home or it
could have been a lot worse," she said.
The event, which took place in Chingford, East London,
followed a series of incidents at Mrs X's home over the last
couple of weeks. These have included a broken window,
racial abuse, and rubbish in the garden.
The matter was taken up with the local school attended
by the boys and the matter was dealt with by the
headmaster.
'DIDN'T CARE'
"I'm satisfied that he has done his part," she said. "He
sent me a letter telling me that he had informed the boys
involved and their parents that if it occurred again the po-
lice would be contacted. So far we have had no more
harassment."
But she did not receive the same satisfaction with
Chingford Police.
"I was told there was nothing they could do. They didn't
seem to care. I do not want to take the matter to court. I
only want to see it stopped once and for all."
The police say that as far as they are concerned their in-
quiries have shown that the alleged incident was not car-
ried out with criminal intent.

"The accident resulted from
of boys mucking
group
around with a box of matches.
There is no evidence to show
that it was done on purpose.
We are quite satisfied with the
results at the end of the day,"
stated Detective Constable
Hilliard, adding that it was up
to Mrs X to take further action
if she wanted to.
Mrs X refuted the police ex-
planation that it was just a
"prank", declaring that her
neighbour had heard the boys
"bragging about what they had
done."

BERNIE'S
By POLITICAL REPORTER
MR BERNIE Grant, the Labour leader of Haringey
Council in north London and, since Friday, the
Labour candidate for Tottenham, pledged to party
supporters that he would "fight racism within the
Labour Party and outside the Labour Party" whether
he became an MP or not.
"The people," he told a celebratory fund-raising
gathering of West Indians, Indians, Africans and
whites, "are concerned that every Labour govern-
ment that was elected did something against black
people. Either they brought in the racism immigra-
tion law or they did virginity tests against us - or
they deported us or they did something (unpleasant)
to us.
"And those of us who
had supported the Labour
Party are socialists, and
over a period of time we
felt that enough was enough
and we needed to put an
end to that.".
Mr Grant said that black
people in particular were
also very concerned about
whites who "felt they knew
everything about black peo-
ple and were about to repre-
sent black people in parlia-
ment, and we felt that was
absolute nonsense.
"The only people who
can represent black people
are black people."
He praised the controver-

. "We wanted,"
he said, "a Labour Party to
follow
proper socialist
course so we felt that we had
to have a core within the
party where black people
could develop policies and
procedures so that we could
put forward our point of
view in order that we could
get justice and equality
within the society."
It was the presence of
black sections that made his
selection and that of three
other blacks Mr Russell
Profitt in Lewisham East,
Mr Paul Boateng in Brent
South and Mr Keith Vaz in
Leicester East in safe or
winnable seats possible.
Black sections, he said,
had "raised the temperature
so that everybody was talk-
ing about the possibility of
having black MPs for the
first time in a serious
manner."
Mr Grant won the selec-
tion from the incumbent,
Mr Norman Atkinson, who
is 62 and has represented
the rock hard Labour con-
stituency for 21 years.
DISTRESSED
AND ANGRY
"I am scared of what would
happen if my children were at
home on their own," she said,
still distressed and angry.
"There have been so many
reports in the papers of people
dying in arson attacks - it is
happening too frequently."
She intends to take the mat-
ter further with the Council for
Racial Equality.
"I'm not resting until some-
thing is done before it is too
late," she said.
