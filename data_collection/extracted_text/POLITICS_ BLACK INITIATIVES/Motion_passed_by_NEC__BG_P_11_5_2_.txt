Motion passed by N.E.C. 25/3/87.
This N.E.C. deplores the reports emanating from the
mofficial conference of Labour Party Black Sections held
in Nottingham on 14/15th March, and condemns the statements
attributed to that meeting that imply separtist organisations +
caucuses in a way that is both divisive and contrary to the
central principles and constitution of the Party.
We further resolve that any decision to undertake Separatist
action with regard to selective support for candidates, or
statements or manifestos will result in action being taken
under the Party Constitution against any party members
Endorsing or acting upon such decisions.
The best interests of Black and Asian communities are best
served by everyone in the party, white or black, recognising
The need for positive action and more substantial
representation of the interests of ethnic minorities in the
Party, and in society, but continuing to resist firmly
divisive calls for separatist organisations.
To this and the N.E.C. ENDORSES the positive work of THE
Party's Black & Asian Committee whose status and resources
have now been Enhanced.
