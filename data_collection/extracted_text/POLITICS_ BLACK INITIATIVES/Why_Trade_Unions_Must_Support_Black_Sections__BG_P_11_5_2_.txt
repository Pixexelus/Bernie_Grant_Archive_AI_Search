WELL OVER HALF OF ALL BLACK WORKERS ARE MEMBERS OF TRADES UNIONS TEN PER CENT
MORE THAN WHITE WORKERS.. BLACK PEOPLE FORM A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF THE
MEMBERSHIP OF TRADES UNIONS AND ARE JUST AS ACTIVE. BUT ONLY FOUR PER CENT OF
BLACK WORKERS HAVE RISEN TO ELECTED T.U. POSTS COMPARED TO ELEVEN PER CENT OF
WHITE WORKERS. INSTITUTIONAL RACISM IS AN OBSTACLE IN THE LABOUR MOVEMENT.
IS AN OBSTACLE THAT BLACK SECTIONS IN THE LABOUR PARTY ARE TRYING TO REMOVE.
Solidarity
The dispute at Grunwick showed the be-
ginnings of the support and solidarity
of the movement with Black struggles.
Consistent support has, however, failed
to materialise.
We
Yet now as never before that support
is needed. Today workers in Britain
are engaged in a crucial fight-back
against a vicious Tory government.
must not forget that 3,000 Black workers
were involved in the miners' heroic
struggle.
The miners suffered police brutality,
as did comrades in the summer uprisings
of 1981 at Handsworth, Brixton and
Tottenham in 1985, and are now enduring
on the picket lines at Wapping.
The NUM,
NUPE and the NUR have so far been the only
major unions to show solidarity with the
Black community and support the Labour
Party Black Sections.
As we have strongly supported you in
the past, sisters and brothers, we now
urge you to stand and fight with us for
Black political equality.
Votes
IT
Trades Unions hold 98% of the yote
at the Labour Party Conference and
we ask you to use your votes positively
to help us win the Black Sections
debate.
Traditionally the trades unions
have fought an historic battle against
disadvantage and oppression. Again,
today, the unions have a role to play.
Because there hasn't been an official
debate within the trades union movement,
this is no reason to simply maintain
position of "wait and see"at Labour
Party Conference, as some suggest.
Support
We have already received encouraging
messages of support from individual
members of the TGWU, NUM, NUR, NUPE,
ACTT and GMBATU. Unions with a high
level of Black members, especially in
the public sector, must be very mindful
of the demands for equality of their
Black members.
We urge union members to:
1) pass resolutions in support of Labour Party Black Sections/your
trade union Black Caucuses through your branch.
2) mandate your delegates to vote for Black Sections at union and
Labour Party conferences. Don't be guilty of not even listening
to our views. We've gone unheard for too long.
3) hear our arguments by inviting speakers to branch meetings.
4) donate money to our campaign.
