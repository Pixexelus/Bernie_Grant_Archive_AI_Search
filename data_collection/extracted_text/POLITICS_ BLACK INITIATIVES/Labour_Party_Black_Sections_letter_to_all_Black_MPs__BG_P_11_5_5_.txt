following
resolution was passed, and is now being forwarded
you in the hope that you can take on this issue in Parliament
"This Black Sections National Committee notes
the
:
to
1) That Frank Critchlow, proprietor of the Mangrove
restaurant and community association, was arrested in May 1988 on
charges of drug possession and allowing his premises to be used
for drug dealing%;B
2) That Frank Critchlow denied all of the charges claiming
that the drugs had been planted by the police in an attempt to
fit him up';
3) That 66 police officers, from constable through to Chief
Superintendent Pearman, testified against Frank Critchlow in
court;
4) At the end of the trial the jury found Frank Critchlow
NOT GUILTY on all charges;
zone
5) As a result of the bail restrictions (which included the
establishment of a 500 yard exclusion
around his
restaurant), Frank Critchlow's business has suffered possibly
irreperable damage.
-
This Black Sections national Committee believes
1) The credibility of the Notting Hill police force, as
impartial officers of the law, has been damaged beyong repair.
This is especially true of Chief Superintendent pearman whose
previous actions have shown that he is hostile to the mangrove
community association and its associated projects.
This Black Section National Committee demands
1) That the parliamentary Black Caucus present a motion in
the following terms to parliament :
a) Demanding a full public inquiry into the
police station and its policing policies;
b)
Demanding the
Superintendent Pearman;
Notting
Hill
immediate resignation
of
Chief
for
Frank
c) Demanding full and fair compensation
Critchlow."
I hope that you will be able to take on this issue.
Yours in struggle,
