Dear Bernie
I understand from the media that there is a meeting on 7 April in Birmingham
advocating black sections and that you are billed as one of the speakers. It is
being organised by a group in support of black sections and is on the day of the
City Council Meeting. The proposed meeting is attracting a fair amount of
adverse publicity and a number of Labour Party members, both black and white,
have spoken to me about it and they expressed their disquiet.
Conference, of course, whole heartedly decided against black sections of the
Labour Party and whilst I appreciate that you do not always accept Conference
decisions I think that such a meeting, in Birmingham, will harm the Labour
Party.
Could you not persuade the organisers of this meeting to abandon it or failing
that refuse to take part in it.
Yours fraternally
Rich.
