Thatcher says sanctions won't help our black people
The people she wants to help most I don't think so
We'll fight for the freedom in the land of our birth
Cos' our people will suffer so prepare for the worst
We want sanctions now! You're buying it, you're wearing it
Playing sports and SUN CITY we ain't doing it
Civilised people got to be sad
The British won't sanction buy they'll wish they had
DEMON BOYZ
Murdering children for throwing stones
The police terrorise our brothers' homes
Now watch me sit down 'pon top of the riddim
Saying that absurd
And in the third world Mike Jay will be heard
Well it's me Demon D the MC thriller and chiller
I'm not a black killer like Botha
Who the hell voted what's the motive
For killing South African children
ICEPICK
The world at large has a game plan
Protection of their investments means they seem to play blindman!
Turning their backs when they know the facts on this
Fooled by Botha who draws a scene of a picturesque
Racially improving national party
The cameras never show the thousands of bodies
That perish pursuing the protest against
The paleface who tries to displace the black race

JUNIOR SAN
Bananas and grapes with the name of Cape
If you buy these, I'm asking you to stop
The money that you spend on South African fruit IGHT AL
You're really buying Mr Botha's crop
So that's money for guns, Botha's delight
Loss of black blood, loss of black life
If my brothers see fit to make a sacrifice
Blood's thicker than water, so I don't think twice
FRESHSKI
Here's a place governed by a certain set of rules
With so much wealth and a power plan which pulls
A white minority with authority
Have a stronghold where the black majority
Are compelled by law to endure
In a land they rightfully own
How do you stand when subjected to an unclean regime
Which means your skin....tone determines
Your work, health and home
STANDING OVATION
Eaten away every day, from the inside
A brother died cause his pride was denied
By a racist regime for a white man it was heaven
But for a black man nearer Armageddon
So beyond the Sixteenth Parallel is where we venture
Though people may stop us and say who sent ya
Pursue, renew a long lost sort of freedom
These are the words of a brother movement
So heed them
MC MELLO
Brothers and sisters depressed and oppressed holds
A noose around their neck a noose around their soul
They can't vote and I quote that is far from dope
Yet they cope, and the fire in their hearts breeds hope
Injustice is dealt to the child and the mother
Dark skinned brother, another they try to smother
Reality ruled by low morality
Minority rule the majority. Inequality
GATECRASH
Nelson Mandela, a fellow black brother
A rot ina jail ina South Africa
Fighting for freedom but still not free
Twenty six years separated from his family
To liberate, to educate, he left the country for support
Jailed for leaving without a passport
Boy...this wicked system surely must fall
When Mandela is free, detainees and all
HIJACK
Steve Biko black hero in the hall of fame
Freedom fighter for those oppressed, killed by the oppressor
A spirit of Africa his belief was not to kill another
But to murder the idea one man's superior
The brothers in ghettos of Soweto they stand alone
Hypocritical governors, they sit upon their throne
We expose this insanity, apartheid's on trial
For crimes against humanity"
TROUBLE AND BASS
Give one man a uniform, gun by his side
Make him some promises, strangle his pride
In his people, their right to be equal
Tell him he's better than those who would fight
For what he's achieved; to stand by a white man
Under a flag that would murder his colour
And pay him to do so like Judas and others
But when innocents die, what they promised was lies
SHE ROCKERS
Ebony hear your name, I feel your pain
Child plucked from the bosom
And detainees in chains
From school to a tomb
Called a cell where they dwell
Tortured and killed in a living hell
The children die
The mothers cry
Our hearts are bleeding and asking why
From birth to death caught in a man trap
Not born proud to be black
But born to stay back
