must be guaranteed. Positive policies aimed at ending racism - including
contracts compliance and employment equality targets - must be
implemented.
The health service workers - many of whom are low paid and Black - must
be properly valued and rewarded. The NHS should be adequately resourced.
Education for all means a crusade against racist stereo-typing by the
British school system. The culture, achievements and history of Black
people must be positively portrayed.
Racist immigration laws must be repealed. The police must be freed of
racist practices and placed under the democratic control of elected
representatives. We fully support Black Section policy on policing in
that the next Labour Government must:
1.) Repeal the 1984 Police Act, the Public Order Act and the Prevention.
of Terrorism Act;
2. Enshrine in law the duty of the police to prosecute perpetrators of
race attacks;
3. Set up a fully independent police complaints body;
4. Ban the manufacture, stock-piling, and use of firearms, CS gas,
plastic bullets, water cannon and other life-endangering equipment.
Black Section supporters on the NEC will be accountable to all
Constituency Labour Parties and will communicate regularly with them.
There will be report backs and discussions with the Labour Party Black
Section National Committee, its annual conference and duly elected
officers.
