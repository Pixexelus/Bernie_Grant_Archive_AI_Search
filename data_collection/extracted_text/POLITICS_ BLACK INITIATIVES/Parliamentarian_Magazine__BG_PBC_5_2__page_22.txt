REFORMS TO ERADICATE

would not reduce the overall willingness
to lock up offenders.
(h) Clear, positive action to redress
The Society would propose a number any disparity evidenced by the monitor-
of reforms to include:-
(a) Full anti-racism training for all
solicitors, barristers, and members of the
judiciary and magistracy.
(b) Annual up-date on sentencing
practice for the judiciary and magistracy
(race as a topic to be examined).
(c) Amendment of the Bail Act so
that there is a duty to consider race, back-
ground, culture and ethnic origin when
considering bail.
(d) The automatic grant of bail for
summary only offences unless the defen-
dant has allegedly committed three or
more offences already whilst on bail for
that charge.
(e) Adoption of a race code of con-
duct for the administration of courts and
staff.
(f) The aim to ensure that the legal
profession, probation service, judiciary
and magistracy truly reflect the racial
composition of society.
ing put forward.
CONCLUSION
This country is now spending a re-
cord Â£1.14 billion on our prisons, a total
increase on the figure of 42 percent be-
tween the original 1989 estimate and cur-
rent estimates. This, the Society of Black
Lawyers would say, is worse than burn-
ing money, as for many people, incar-
ceration only increases the likelihood of
a return to crime, prison and more expen-
diture. Despite all the expenditure, there
is no return on the investment; by the end
of the century, at least 8,000 cells will
still be without sanitation.
It seems even the right-wing Centre
for Policy Studies is proposing an inde-
pendent sentencing council which would
set guidelines on sentencing and estab-
lish principles for courts to adopt. This is
a measure the Society has advocated for
some time but it is absolutely essential
that the Government deals with the ra-
(g) The full implementation of anti- cism inherent in the system. An inde-
Custody must genuinely be used as
the last and not the first resort. There
must also be greater emphasis on re-
education for those in custody as op-
posed to a 23-hour lock up regime.
Events such as the riots at Ridley Re-
mand Centre will occur with greater fre-
quency unless urgent action is taken.
The degree of maturity achieved by a
society is marked in part by the degree of
understanding and flexibility it shows to
those who have broken its rules. It is
high time in this country that we
achieved that degree of maturity.
Equality of treatment before the law
is a fundamental human right which is at
present being denied to Black people in
Britain. A democracy, however, does
not in itself guarantee that freedom with-
out commitment from those in authority.
If the racism which pervades the Crimi-
nal Justice System is allowed to continue
unchecked, we will all suffer in the years
to come.
* The Society of Black Lawyers was created by lawyers of African and Asian descent in the late 1970's to further the inter-
ests of Black people in the legal profession and in the country generally.

It was indeed a pleasure, privilege, and honor to have
participated in the Inaugural Activities of the Parliamentary Black
Caucus. You need to know how much we appreciated your friendship,
comradery, hospitality, and generosity during our short but
meaningful stay in London, England for the founding of the
Parlimentary Black Caucus. You are definitely the quintessential
grassroots brothers and sisters of the movement; and we would love
to continue working with you to help strengthen and link the
community. We are at your immediate disposal to ensure that the
common bond connecting our brothers and sisters across the waters
with mutual issues that impact our constituencies across the United
States is not lost.
Again, thank you for allowing us to participate, and we look
forward to working with you more closely in the near future.
