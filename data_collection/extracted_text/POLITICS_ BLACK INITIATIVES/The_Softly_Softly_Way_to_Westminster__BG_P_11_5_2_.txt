Bernie Grant: 'There is racism in the Labour Party,' he said softly, 'but I would not say Labour was a racist party'
The softly softly
to Westminster
way
T
his is the utility-concrete Harin- Bernie Grant talks vantage. We promise anyone in the Labour
gey Civic Centre, administrative
heart of a latter-day Sodom and
Gomorrah, where the British way
of life is believed (by some) to be in serious
danger at the hands of black Marxists, ho-
mosexuals and so forth.
Its bearded "evil genius" - who is suf-
fering from the side-effects of diabetes
has just come (whirring) into the council
leader's office in a battery-driven wheel-
chair, accompanied by a lady whom he
called his "partner".

Bernard Alexander Montgomery Grant,
The Sun's "barmy Bernie" ex-BR clerk
at King's Cross, ex-student, ex-interna-
tional telephone operator, ex-NUPE
organiser and Labour parliamentary candi-
date for Tottenham has been involved in
two unusual political initiatives this week.
One is an invitation to Mr Gorbachev to
visit the borough, and "examine our con-
cerns at first hand". (The reply is still
awaited.) The other is an unexpected inter-
vention by Mr Grant in the long-running
struggle by black activists to establish
"black sections" in the Labour Party;
against which the party, and most notably
Roy Hattersley, is pitted, as being
"unconstitutional", a form of "apartheid",
and the rest of it.
On this question, Mr Grant's new posi-
ve tion, with three other black parliamentary
candidates, is that "getting Labour into
government" is their "overriding interest";
"black sections" which he now calls a
"diversion" are to be put on the back
burner.

But in our conversation, Mr Grant took
ad specific issue with Sharon Atkin, the La-
bour candidate for Nottingham East, for
denouncing her own party as "racist" at last
week's black sections meeting in Birming-
ham. "I would never say stuff like that," Mr
Grant declared very softly, manoeuvring
If, carefully towards Westminster's green
benches. "There is racism in the Labour
Party, but I would not say Labour was a rac-
ist party."

This is a finely balanced point, or a dis-

way it is not particularly barmy. Have you, I
asked Mr Grant, turned into a moderate, as
of polling day approaches? "That," said Mr
Grant, still softly and smiling, "is a catch
question." Why? "Because it assumes that
I wasn't a moderate to start with." (Mr
Grant's partner, Councillor Sharon Law-
rence, also smiled benignly, fair hair in a
tousle, and wearing large pink earrings.)

"I have always been a bit cautious about
the strategy for setting up black sections,"
Mr Grant went on, the pot about to blacken
the kettle. "We called on people to keep
their heads down. It is extremely unfortu-
nate if you have black parliamentary candi-
dates getting carried away at unruly meet-
ings. Some people said things at the
Birmingham conference that shouldn't
to David
Selbourne about
getting Labour
into government
have been said."; Linda Bellos, Lambeth's
leader, had shouted: "We don't want white
members of the Labour Party to speak for
us," and there was the usual talk of "white
Labour MPs" Roy Hattersley in
Sparkbrook for one "riding on our backs
in their rotten boroughs".

But you have said the same kind of
things, haven't you? "First, we as blacks
speak a different language," Mr Grant an-
swered, arousing for a moment, but still
softly, the ghost of PC Blakelock. "Second,
nobody understands the pressure black
candidates are under."
Such as? "Pressure from the party
leadership" - "sending us disgraceful let-
ters to stay away from Birmingham" is how
he put it "from our own black activists
pressing us, pressure from the media". This
many-sided pressure (driving black spokes-
men to "say things they do not mean"), Mr
Grant called, sighing, a "heavy scene".
No doubt it is. But in particular, Mr
Grant has it in for Gwyneth Dunwoody,
MP for Crewe, and (white) member of the
bogged-down Black and Asian Sub-com-
mittee of Labour's NEC. This is the party
rulebook's "constitutional" alternative to
unseemly black agitation; strangely forgot-
ten, though not in black circles, is that
Larry Whitty, the party's general secretary,
now mulling over the question of "disci-
plinary action", was himself once an advo-
cate of separate black sections.
T
he "right wing" Mrs Dunwoody
has said of the black activists that
they, out of political "ambition",
are "making a great deal of noise
without a great deal of thought". Mr Grant
says of her that "she is the kind of person
who will leave the Labour Party". Roy
Hattersley, who has pitched in against
black sections ("equivalent to political
Aids") with the energy of a man possessed,
Mr Grant cannot bring himself to call by
name. "With a bit of luck," Mr Grant said
under his breath, "he may also leave the
party."
Not in doubt, however, is that "the strug-
gle will continue". What struggle? (Here,
Councillor Lawrence, in a large flamboyant
necklace, listened more intensely than
ever, hawk-eared lest Bernie put his foot in
it.) "The struggle to deal with racial disad-
Party that this struggle will go on. When we
are in Parliament, that struggle will be
heightened. We can promise you that," he
added, lightly tapping the table.

"They can proscribe black sections, but
they will never keep the issue of black
representation out of the Labour party. a
Dunwoody and whoever can't just rubbish
what we are saying. Whatever the Labour
Party does on racial disadvantage will have
to be acceptable to its black MPs. It can't
have a policy on race and leave me out of
it."
And a black parliamentary caucus? "No-
body will stop us sitting and talking
together," he replied briefly, or very
briefly. In 1952, Aneurin Bevan recalled
how the "semi-ecclesiastical ritual" of the
House of Commons, with its "soft-footed
attendants", had dampened his ardour
when he first arrived there, fierily, from the
Rhondda.
What did Mr Grant expect? "I
expect," said Mr Grant, who
was not fooling, "absolute rac-
ism and hostility from the To-
ries and Alliance. But that would be their
problem, not mine. I am only concerned
with the Labour party." (Here, Mr Grant
added that Joe Ashton, the "right-wing"
Labour MP for Bassetlaw, has written to
tell him that he supports the setting up of a
black parliamentary caucus.)
"To the Parliamentary Labour Party, we
would make one thing absolutely clear: we
have special interests to represent, and we
will be raising issues which affect black
people only." What issues? "Racism, and
racial disadvantage," he answered.
Are you not yourself sick of this preoccu-
pation? "No. To me it is a way of life. I only
have to go out of London to realise the rac-
ism of this country." ("We went to a cot-
tage in Wales," Councillor Lawrence inter-
posed, "and this little girl screamed and
dropped her bag when she saw Bernie.")
"The most important part of getting into
Parliament," Mr Grant went on, "is black
self-respect," or what he also called "the
whole thing of image". What do you mean?
"Young blacks need somebody they can
look up to as a black." "They're thirsting
for a figure-head," Councillor Lawrence
added. "Racists know that too," said Mr
Grant, in his wheelchair at the table, "that's
why they don't want us to get there."
Mr Grant has inherited a 9,000-plus La-
bour majority in Tottenham, though, like
the Labour party itself, he has the required
skills to lose it.
And after Labour's third defeat, I asked
him, won't there be party recriminations,
including against the black sections activ-
ists? "There'll be heavy recriminations,"
Mr Grant answered bravely, and to his
credit. "That's why we asked the others to
cool it."
