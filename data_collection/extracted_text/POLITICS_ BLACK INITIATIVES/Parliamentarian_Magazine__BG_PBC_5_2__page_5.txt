-
First of all, I'd like to welcome the
launch of the Parliamentary Black
Caucus and of this publication.
The Labour Party took a huge step
forward when Black MPs were elected
to Parliament in 1987. But, I am not
going to pretend that we as a move-
ment do not have a long way to go.
Both in terms of representation and of
policy, there is an enormous job still to

be done. That requires careful
thought and planning by Black people
in the movement, but above all, it re-
quires an open and willing response
from the movement as a whole.
After all, anti-racism means social
and political change. That places a heavy
burden on the institutions of the labour
movement. On the one hand, Black peo-
ple are looking to direct and lead the
movement, and on the other, they are
rightly protesting at its own discrimina-
tion and injustices.
Take the whole issue of Black repre-
sentation and organisation in the trade
unions. The Transport and General
Workers' Union and others have identi-

fied a major change now taking place in
the UK economy: the division of our
labour market into a core workforce with
relatively good pay, conditions, and job
security, and the growing army of tempo-
rary, casual, part-time and de-skilled
workers.
That's a matter of equal opportuni-
ties, because the majority of mar-
ginalised workers are women, and many
are young and from ethnic minorities.
And if you want to recruit, you have to
represent. Black people will not join a
union or any other organisation that does
not give them a voice.
And changing collective bargaining
isn't easy either. How many deals and
recognition agreements include an equal
opportunities clause? How much practi-
cal trade union support is there for effec-
tive ethnic monitoring?
Racial harassment remains a fact of
life for many Black workers and overt ra-
cism exists amongst trade unionists as

well as employers. When Black workers You CAN
complain to stewards or officials about
such behaviour, action has got to be
taken. Rhetoric and pious expressions of
concern are not enough.
If anti-racism is about work for social
and institutional change - then all sec-
tions of the trade unions movement must
be involved. There are inspiring exam-
ples to be found, for example, of trade
union involvement in struggles against
deportations, but they are still too few.
The problem is not ideas for change
- they are easy to find. Rather it is a
question of the will to implement them.
There are clear questions of resources, of
priorities and, frankly, of power.
If unions set up advisory committees,
improve the proportion of ethnic minor-
ity officers, and promote Black people
through lay representative structures,
then power in the union will shift. And
that can be a difficult process. Some es-
tablished interests may even find it a
threat. That is one reason why you will
find resistance in parts of even the most
progressive union to the notion that race
equality is something we ought to be con-
cerned about within our ranks.
And that truth applies every bit as
much to the Labour Party. That's why
the debate about Black representation
has been so hard-fought and so im-
portant. I think there is, for example, a
real feeling of impatience that the pro-
posal for a Black socialist society, which
the last Labour Party conference passed
so clearly, is still being fought over at the
Party's National Executive Committee.
My Union has played a constructive
role throughout that debate. And we cer-
tainly hope that it will now be resolved in
a way that satisfies the terms of the Con-

Time to listen to women's needs
ference resolutions--and the hopes they
clearly represent. We are certainly not
going to sit idly by if an attempt is made
to frustrate the Party's clear and demo-
cratic will.
But the establishment of a working
and successful society with proper repre-
sentation at all levels of the Labour
movement - which I'm sure we are go-
ing to see-will only be one further step
on a long road.
We also have a job to do in making
sure that anti-racist values permeate the
Party's policy-making and campaigning.
I was a member of the Party's Policy Re-
view Group on Economic Equality. I
would certainly not criticise the final re-
port, which I think is a constructive and
useful effort in a very complex and po-
tentially expensive area. And I know that
everyone involved in the Group made
(Photo by Humphrey Nemar)
every effort to see that anti-racist con-
cerns were fully considered in its work.
But that job was made more difficult, not
by any failing on the part of the Group or
its members, but because the organisa-
tion of Black people within the Party is
still too weak.
A Black socialist society could go a
long way to help with that problem. It
could rightly expect to be consulted and
involved in a very wide range of policy
discussions, from housing to the Na-
tional Health Service, from education to
crime. And if, as my Union certainly
hopes, we see a reform of the whole Party
policy-making system which makes it
more genuinely democratic and par-
ticipative, then Black people at every
level of the Party will play their full part.
The Parliamentary Black Caucus has
an important potential role as well. Of
course, its members will rightly want
their say on policy. Between them they
have an experience and an expertise
which the Party badly needs. But they
have an even more important role. Par-
liament remains an essential forum for
discussion and debate. It is important.
And it is vital - if Black people are to
have confidence in our democracy
that their voice is clearly heard. Already
Black MPs have made big steps in that
direction. They deserve our help and our
support.
That may not always be comfortable
for established interests even in the
labour movement. But it is a political im-
perative. On it, the success of Britain as a
genuinely tolerant and democratic soci-
ety may well turn.
I am not a pessimist about the future
of our movement. I wouldn't be an ac-
tive trade unionist if I was. But I do think
that Black people at every level are mak-
ing a clear and distinct challenge to it.
Will the labour movement listen to us?
Will it accept the contribution we can
make? For the sake of our society, we
must make sure the answer is yes.
