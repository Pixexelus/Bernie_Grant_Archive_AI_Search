On behalf of the Parliamentary Black Caucus, (PBC), I would like to welcome you to this, the first edition of
The Black Parliamentarian, the magazine of the PBC. We intend to ensure that the magazine is used as a fo-
rum for discussion within the Black communities. No issue will be too controversial for this magazine, nothing
affecting the Black communities will be too "hot" or too "cool" for the magazine to handle.
What Will The Black Parliamentarian Provide?
We intend to bring to you all those issues which are not covered by the national media, e.g., what are the Black
MPs doing in Parliament? Well, we are asking questions of the Prime Minister and other Ministers but they are rarely
covered in the national media. We are taking part in Committees discussing laws like the Poll Tax, Immigration Acts,
Children's Bill, Finance Acts etc. We are making important speeches on issues like South Africa, Namibia and the
way in which the Secret Service is being run. We are going abroad on Parliamentary and other visits to places as far
apart as Turkey and Trinidad and Tobago. We are meeting people from all over the globe, including such places as
Belau in the Pacific and Alaska. We are discussing domestic issues such as Black Women, Immigration, the NHS,
Education, the Environment, the Budget, Racism, the Police, the Carnival, Adoption issues etc. We won't be serious
all the time and we intend to let you know all the parliamentary gossip that "serious" newspapers don't print, like the
time the House of Commons Catering Department decided to "go ethnic" and put Ackee and Saltfish on the menu in
the Members' Cafeteria. It tasted lovely but had one fault! The price was £5 per portion whilst other meals were
around £2. There were quite a lot of requests but the price put a lot of people off. I waited until they were forced to put
the price down to £1.50p before I ordered. Unfortunately, they have informed me that due to lack of orders they have
been forced to remove it from the menu.
We intend to discuss all these issues with you in this and future editions. We intend to ensure that these very
important issues are forced to the top of the agenda in Parliament and elsewhere. We also intend to circulate the maga-
zine in the USA, where we have developed links with the Congressional Black Caucus. We want to contact Black
Canadians, French people, Dutch people and other Black European Parliamentarians and others. This is particularly
important because of the advent of 1992 and the Single European Market. We want to debate within our communi-
ties what 1992 holds for us. The article in this first issue by Ansel Wong, opens up a debate which we must have, if we
are to survive in Europe after 1992. We are also needed to give assistance to our sisters and brothers in Europe who are
not covered by legislation in race relations to the extent that we are. We need to press for an amendment to the Euro-
pean Convention on Human Rights, so that the Convention recognises discrimination on grounds of race. We need to
press for laws in Europe that recognise racial discrimination as an offence as British laws do. We need to fight for the
rights of immigrants in Europe so that they may have the vote in the same way as Commonwealth citizens do in Brit-
ain, whilst making it clear to everyone that we are not in the same position as European immigrants because of our
special relationship with Britain because of the Commonwealth.
We need to discuss the situation regarding the relationship between the EEC and the African, Caribbean and
Pacific countries. We need to press the EEC on what will happen to the banana trade with the Windward Islands,
Jamaica and Belize after 1992, and the Lome Convention. The situation in South Africa, Namibia and the Front Line
states is crucial to the status of Black people in the future.
Are we to be called African-British or Asian-British as the Americans want to be called African-Americans?
What is Jesse Jackson up to in Washington? Can Benazir Bhutto outmanoeuvre the fundamentalists in Pakistan? If
you know the answers maybe you can tell us. What about the death of Huey P Newton, one time Black revolutionary,
and now shot dead in the street like a common hoodlum? The Black politicians and other Black people need to know
your opinions on these issues.
What about Black businesses? How far are we prepared to go to support Black capitalism? Is there a difference
between Black and White capitalists? What are our views on Islamic fundamentalism? Do we support Muslim
schools? Is Salman Rushdie a blasphemer? All views need to be put so that we are as informed as possible.
We intend to print The Black Parliamentarian as often as possible and certainly not less than quarterly. We
expect that arising from the debates around some of the issues I have mentioned, we will go on to hold seminars and
discussion groups around the topics. We want to take these debates around the country and reach some of the more
remote Black communities that have been left out in the great debates that our communities have engaged in over the
past few years.
We believe that such a magazine is urgently needed. We believe that the task of formulating coherent strategies
can no longer be left to chance and the CRE. We are entering unknown waters vis-a-vis the EEC and 1992. We are
entering unchartered waters vis-a-vis an independent Namibia and a future liberated South Africa. We need such a
magazine as The Black Parliamentarian. SUPPORT IT!
