I wish to express my profound concern about the NEC's
imposing a white candidate on Vauxhall constituency against
the clear wishes of the local Labour party and Labour
party voters, particularly black voters, in Vauxhall.
I am a black Councillor in the London Borough of Waltham
Forest where I am Deputy Mayor, Chair of Race Relations
Committee, and a member on the District Health Authority.
The decision of the NEC demonstrates utter insensitivity
to the needs and aspirations of a constituency where
there is a significant black population, and where a
black candidate would have an excellent prospect of
of being
elected. I cannot recall a case where the NEC has imposed
a black candidate on a constituency which is considered
safe white seat.

drawn a list of about four or more black candidates reflecting
a coss section of views within the party for consideration
by the Vauxhall branch.
The NEC's attempt to offer

by Vauxhall branch, and Mr. Kerr himself recognised this
situation by having the grace to stand down.
Although not respected by
choice of
the NEC, the local party's
candidate in Ms Martha Osamor was objective,
and would no doubt have attracted a considerable number
of votes
especially from the black community.
She
has a good record of involvement in a wide range of issues
of public concern.
The allegations against her about
misappropriation should not have deterred the NEC.
In Britain, a person is considered innocent until proved

For Mr. Hattersley to describe Ms Osamor as "immature"
is a gross insult to her and indeed offensive to black
people. He symbolises paternalism and colonialism with
such views. But perhaps that is to

as saying "without integration, limitation is inexcusable,
