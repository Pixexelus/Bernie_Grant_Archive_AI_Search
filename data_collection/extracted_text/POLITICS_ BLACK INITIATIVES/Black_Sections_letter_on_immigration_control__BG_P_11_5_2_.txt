Dear Comrades,
The Labour Party Black Sections have now a comprehensive
policy against Immigration Control which was accepted by our conference
in April.
We are writing to you to inform you that it is our hope to be more
involved in campaigning around the issue of Immigration generally and to
be involved in particular cases. As you know there are now 4 Black
Members of Parliament and we shall of course be working with them as no
doubt you will as well.
The reason we are writing to yoursleves is to request that firstly we be
put on to your mailing list. If there is a charge for this could you
please inform us so that we may make the appropriate arrangements.
we
Secondly, we would ask that we be notified of any demonstrations,
campaigns, issues, lobbies in which we may participate. Of course
will from our side keep you informed of our activities and request your
attendence in any similar activity. In addition we do a monthly mailing
of around seventy people, mainly L. P. Black Section branches. As such if
wish to have something circulated to our membership please do not
hesitate to send enough material for us to include in our mailing.
Finally, Black Sections will obviously assist you in whatever way we
can, however, as probably with yourselves resources are limited. We hope
that you
will see nonetheless that our committment to fighting these.
Racist and oppressive laws is paramount.
We look forward to hearing from you and hope that we can work together
on this very important issue which affects the Black Community everyday.
Yours comradely
Sanjiv Vedi
Asst Nat. Sec
Immigration Co-ordinator.
