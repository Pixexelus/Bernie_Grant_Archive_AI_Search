Dear Mr. Grant:
It was a great pleasure to have the opportunity
to meet you on my recent visit to London.
My wife
and I both considered this a wonderful chance to talk
with our brethren on the "other side" of the
Atlantic. The occasion was one we will remember with
great fondness.
As I mentioned to you, I am sending with this
letter a copy of my legislation addressing the needs
of the Caribbean. I hope you will find it informative.
Thank you again for your warmth and hospitality;
we look forward to seeing you again.

Dear Members of Parliament:
27 APR 1989
On behalf of the National Black Caucus of Local Elected
Officials, I would like to thank you, the Black Members of
Parliament, for including the National Policy Institute in
the ceremonies celebrating your installation.
The experience of being there in the House of Parliament not
only provided us with a sense of history, but also made each
of us very proud to witness the beginning of something very
great and important.
As your cousin across the sea, we stand ready to assist you
in any manner that is necessary. Therefore, always feel
free to contact us if needed.
May God bless each and every one of you.
Sincerely,
Rellustine R. Willin
