Dear Bernie,
This letter is to confirm the invitation we made at the Black Section
Conference for you to speak at the first public meeting of the
The meeting is being
Birmingham District Labour Party Black Section.
held at The Summerfield Centre in Winson Green (near Handsworth) at
7:30pm on Tuesday, 7th April. The meeting is very important for us and
we hope to get a large number of people to join the Labour Party and the
Black Section. It will be the first publiic meeting since we formed the
Black Section in September last year, although we have already made
quite an impact particularly with the protests we made over the sacking
of C'llr Phillip Murphy.
I hope you are still able to make the meeting despite your busy schedule
and of course we will pay for your travelling expenses. We will arrange
for transport from Birmingham New Street to the meeting or send
directions if you are coming by car. If you need overnight
accommodation in Birmingham please let me know.
We have also invited the Black Community Action Group from Wolverhampton
who are campaigning for justice over the death of Clinton McCurbin, and
the Pakistan Peoples Party because the Labour Chairperson of the Race
Relations and Equal Opportunities Committee (the one who sacked Phil
Murphy) has invited the Prime Minister of Pakistan to speak in
Birmingham! We hope to raise a campaign that will send both the Prime
Minister and the Chairperson packing.
We are looking forward to hearing you on 7th April, but if there are any
problems please let me know.
Yours in solidarity,
Chris Khamis
