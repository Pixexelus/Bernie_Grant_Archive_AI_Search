WE WILL FIGHT ON, BLACK
Campaign to be stepped up
A renewed onslaught against Labour par-
ty chiefs is underway in a bid to get Black
Sections officially recognised.
The Black Sections
leadership is now planning
a new strategy for the for-
thcoming year in answer to
last week's Labour Party
conference vote against a
separate black body.
"There is all to play for
between now and next
year", Narendra Makanji,
the Black Sections' Chair,
said adamantly..
BERNIE
GRANT:
"Change of tactics need-
ed."
Black Sections are aim-
ing to raise support in
Scotland where there is a
large Asian population.
They are also planning to
put up their own
didates at elections and to
target the trade unions.

"We have exposed the
inadequacies of the unions
who take their own black
members for granted.
When black trade unionists
come together they are
bound to change that,"
remarked Mr Makanji,
referring to the General
Municipal Workers and
Engineering Workers
Unions' bloc 'no' vote
against sections.
Labour Party bosses had
proposed a Black Socialist
Society in which white
members would have
voting rights to determine
who the black leadership
would be.
Black Sections activists
and black MPs rejected this
as a 'choc ice' solution.
And the rejection of the
proposal at the annual con-
ference was seen as a slap
in the face for the party
leadership.

"What is needed is to
put the leadership on a
course of racism aware-
ness training," said Bernie
Grant, MP for Tottenham
South.
He added: "We need to
change our tactics. I would
call on Neil Kinnock and
Roy Hattersley to have
direct talks with us we
cannot afford to have
these squabbles as we
come up to a next general
election."
But Roy Hattersley
remarked: "Black Sections
have gone away. We have
defeated a motion on
separatist organisations for
the fourth year running.
You cannot go on pushing
the same case at party
conference every year."
However, campaigners
are encouraged that the
Black Sections proposal
received over a million
votes in support: They now
plan to hold a national con-
ference in London on
November 5.
