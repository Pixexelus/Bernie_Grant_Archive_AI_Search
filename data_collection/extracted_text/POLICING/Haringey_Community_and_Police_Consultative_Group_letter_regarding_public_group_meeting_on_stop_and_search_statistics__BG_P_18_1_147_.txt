Dear Mr Grant M.P.
Re: TOTTENHAM
STOP AND SEARCH STATISTICS
RECEIVED
23 Nov 94
Thank you for your letter dated 7th November 1994, the contents
of which have been noted with great concern.
The subject of your letter was raised at our Executive meeting,
held on the 9th November 1994, but due to lack of time, the
Committee were unable to fully discuss or resolve ways in which
this issue could be effectively tackled.
However, it was decided that the matter should be referred to the
next full public group meeting of Haringey Community and Police
Consultative Group which will be held on the 23rd November 1994.
As you are aware, Tottenham and Hornsey Chief Superintendent
Officers attend the public meetings and we are asking them to
specifically respond to the issues you have highlighted. They
will then answer questions from those present in regards to
policing in Haringey, and particularly this matter of stop and
search and the effects on our ethnic minority communities.
We very much hope that you will be able to attend our next
meeting on the above date in order to express forcefully your
opinions and contribute to the facts being made known and assist
in our concerns being addressed.
We look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely
Chris Hugh
Chris Hannington, O.B.E.
