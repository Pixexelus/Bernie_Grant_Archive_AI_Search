Dear Mr GRANT,
RE: Tottenham - Stop and Search Statistics
Further to our recent correspondence you will be aware that as a result of your letter, the
subject of stop/search in Tottenham was raised as an agenda item at last nights Haringey
Community and Police Consultative Group Meeting. I spoke to the subject and there
then followed an animated and extremely useful debate which allowed for contributions
from the floor. It was finally agreed that the matter would be remitted to the next
meeting of the Executive Committee by which time it was anticipated that I would have
been able to send a detailed reply to you.
In essence your letter raises two separate but related issues.
i) The seemingly excessive increase in the total number of searches conducted
under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act in 1994 compared with 1993.
ii)
The possibility that this may be a function of racial bias by my officers.
The latter point is of course of fundamental importance and goes to the heart of my role
as a senior police commander. It is vital that you and the community you represent have
confidence in my commitment to maintain and ensure the highest standards of behaviour
amongst my personnel, for without such confidence the whole concept of community
policing and policing by consent is flawed.
