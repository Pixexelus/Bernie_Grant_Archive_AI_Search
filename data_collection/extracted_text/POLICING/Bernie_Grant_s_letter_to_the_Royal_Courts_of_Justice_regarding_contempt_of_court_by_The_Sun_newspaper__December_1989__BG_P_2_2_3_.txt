Dear Sir Patrick,
Re: Alleged contempt of court by the 'Sun' newspaper, January 1987.
I am writing to you with regard to the above matter,
brought to my attention by a constituent.
which has been
as follows. In
The facts of the matter, as I undertand them, are
January 1985, on or about the second day of the Blakelock murder
trial, the 'Sun' - the most widely read newspaper in the country
published on its front page a photograph of one of the defendents
that trial, Winston Silcott, next to a banner headline identifying him
as the person police believed to be the 'ringleader' of the Broadwater
Farm disturbances.
in
At this stage of the trial, the identification of Silcott was still an
issue. In the statements which allegedly identified him as having
taken a leading role (those of one of his juvenile co-defendents), his
identity was concealed. However, there can be little doubt that this
procedure was rendered ineffective by the Sun's action in publishing
his picture in this way.
In
-
The
point of fact, there were and remain serious doubts about the
exact basis for allegations that he was the 'ringleader'.
statements of his juvenile co-defendent were later dismissed by the
trial judge, Justice Hodgson, as fantasy.
be
to your
I understand that Justice Hodgson also commented
on the Sun's front
page in court the day that it appeared, and stated that he would
referring what was a prima facie case of contempt of court
office.
I would be grateful if you could let me know what action
taken and whether you have plans for further action at this
you have
stage.
Yours sincerely,
Pstpant
BERNIE GRANT, MP.
