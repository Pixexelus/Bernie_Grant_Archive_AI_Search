I have been asked by Superintendent Matthew Baggott, who is
currently away on annual leave, to provide you with the additional
information which you requested in your letter of 5 July.
I have collated the information and presented it in the form which
Peter Clarke did in his letter to you dated 5.4.93. The current
information relates to settled actions for 1993 and 1994.
I trust the above will meet your needs.
