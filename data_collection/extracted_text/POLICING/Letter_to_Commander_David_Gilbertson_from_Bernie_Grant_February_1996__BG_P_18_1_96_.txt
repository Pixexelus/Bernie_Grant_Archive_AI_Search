Dear Commander Gilbertson,
LONDON SW1A 0AA
13 February 1996
Thank you for your letter of 1st February letting me know of your promotion to the rank
of Commander, and of your move from Tottenham.
First of all, I must congratulate you on your achievement. To rise to such a high rank in
your profession is something of which you must be very proud, and I am sure that you will
justify the faith which your superiors have placed in you as you carry out your new
responsibilities.
Those of us who got to know you in Tottenham are not at all surprised that you were
chosen for promotion. In the short time that you spent with us, we came to realise that you
were a different kind of policeman - one that we could trust and work with in the interests
of the whole community. I personally appreciated your honesty, and willingness to talk
openly about the problems of policing Tottenham, in the context of the problems of the
community as a whole. Sadly there have been few of your predecessors who have been
prepared or able to match your creativity and integrity in this respect, and on behalf of
Tottenham, I thank you the commitment you showed to us.
Clearly we are very sad to lose you, and somewhat worried about having to develop a new
relationship with your successor. As you know we have had quite a considerable turnover
of command at Tottenham in recent years, and we do need some stability.
I am glad that you will still have inspectorial responsibilities in relation to Tottenham, and
I am sure that in that capacity will shall have cause to be in touch from time to time. Please
do feel free to contact me if I can ever be of help to you in any way.
Yours sincerely,
BERNIE GRANT M.P.
