City of Westminster
STOPPED AND SEARCHED: An irritating and sometimes petty routine.
MP calls for an end to stop
"
and search "discrimination'
BERNIE Grant MP has issued a challenge to Metropoli-
tan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon to explain
why almost half of all the stop and searches carried
out in London are on Black people.
Grant said: "In some parts
of London, 57 per cent of all
stop and search procedures are
carried out on Black people.
This confirms the impression
most Black people have had
for some time."
Among the areas to have
gained notoriety for abnor-
mally-high stops are areas of
high Black concentration -
including: Stoke Newington
and Tottenham, in north Lon-
don; Battersea and Brixton, in
south London, and Notting
Hill in north-west London.
Investigation
Black student Tony Leslie,
who took part in a recent Sun-
day Times investigation into
police stops, told the Voice:
"One night, I was driving a
convertible Mercedes and was
told that both I and it looked
out of place in that part of
north London.
Another time, I was stopped
because they said that at a dis-
tance of 100 metres I looked
like a wanted criminal, and the
last time they claimed it was
just 'routine. It seems to me
that if the constant stopping of
Black people is routine, then
it's a pretty bad routine.
National figures issued last
year sparked an outcry at the
revelation that nearly half of
By Anthony Andr√©
all the people stopped and
searched were, not surprising-
ly, from ethnic minorities.
Although the rules govern-
ing police stop and search
changed dramatically in the
mid-80s with the introduction
of The Police and Criminal
Evidence Act of 1984
('PACE') when strict guide-
lines demanded that police
officers should have reason-
able grounds for suspicion
before carrying out a search -
it has made little difference.
New Scotland Yard has
denied abusing the stop and
search laws. They said: "We
strongly refute any suggestion
that the Metropolitan Police
applies stop and search laws
in a racially-discriminatory
manner."
Condemned
But Mr Grant, sharing a
platform with Andrew Pudde-
phatt, general secretary of
Liberty, the civil liberties
group, condemned the police
figures.
Grant said: "Every day,
somewhere in London, aver-
age Black people are being
subjected to the indignity of
stop and search. It is clear that
Black people in particular are
being singled out by the police
to an extent which cannot be
justified."
Argument
Black people account for
25.5 per cent of stop and
search incidents London-wide
yet, according to the popula-
tion census, represent only
about 9 per cent of London's
population thus reinforcing
the discrimination argument.
In the capital, however, it is
not only the Metropolitan
Police that have come in for
criticism. The City of London
Police has also come under
fire accused of using their
highly-publicised 'ring of
steel' anti-terrorism security
cordon to stop and search eth-
nic minorities.
A spokesman defended the
force: "The style of policing
practised in the city includes a
highly visible, pro-active uni-
formed presence, supplement-
ed by advanced camera tech-
nology."
He added that they would
continue to employ such
methods for prevention and
detection purposes, "in rela-
tion to all styles of criminali-
ty".
Now both Mr Grant and Mr
Puddephatt are calling on the
government to suspend the
implementation of further
changes governing police stop
and search - in the light of the
new Criminal Justice Bill.
They are demanding
detailed examination and
research into current figures
before additional police pow-
ers come into force in March
of this year.
Their concern is centred
around clause 55 of the Justice
Bill, which they believe will
renew the right of the police to
stop and search anyone on a
whim, without having 'rea-
sonable grounds'. This, they
believe, will lead to increased
police harassment of ethnic
minorities.
The new powers will grant
police the right to stop and
search anyone within a specif-
ic area around which a serious
crime has taken place.
Hampshire Chief Constable
Hoddinott spokesman for the
Association of Chief Police
Officers argued: "The exer-
cise of this power will be care-
fully monitored - in particular
regarding ethnic classifica-
tion."
Despite these reassurances,
Mr Grant underlined his deter-
mination to carry the fight fur-
ther, and vowed to urge shad-
ow Home Secretary Jack
Straw to pursue the argument
in the House of Commons.
Grant concluded: "If you
look at these published fig-
ures, you can only imagine
what the real figures are like.'
