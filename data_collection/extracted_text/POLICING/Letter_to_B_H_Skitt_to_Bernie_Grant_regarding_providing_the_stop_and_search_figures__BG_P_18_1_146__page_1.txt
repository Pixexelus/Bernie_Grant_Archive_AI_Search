Dear Mr Grant,
Further to my letter of 24 January 1995, I am now in a position to furnish you with the
stop and search figures for the 1994/95 financial year for all Divisions within the
Metropolitan Police Service as promised.
1 apologise for the delay in their publication, however, we have had a few procedural
and mechanical problems within our data gathering process which I am now assured
have been rectified.
In future the data will be provided on a quarterly basis in the format shown through
Chief Superintendent David Gilbertson at Tottenham. I hope they prove to be of value
to you.
For your information the work in conjunction with Herman Ouseley at the Commission
for Racial Equality is still in its infancy. I anticipate some useful results from the
research which, on completion, I will be in a position to share with you.
Finally I am pleased that your stop and search leaflet initiative has commenced and
look forward to the evaluation in due course.
Yours sincerely
