20AMAZING THINGS
NEVER KNEW
ABOUT BARMY BERNIE
By JAMES WEATHERUP and VAUGHAN FREEMAN
HE'S Britain's first black council leader-
and, since the bloody Tottenham riots
earlier this month, he has become the most
notorious.
Bernie Grant's outrageous comments after
the brutal killing of PC Keith Blakelock
brought protests from Left and Right alike.
But the 41-year-old leader of Haringey Council has
been adopted as Labour's parliamentary candidate
for Tottenham at the next General Election-and
local party chiefs are convinced he'll lose what was
once a solid Labour
seat.
The Sun has probed
the background of Barmy
