Black people in Brixton, Tottenham, Liverpool 8, and Southall, recently rose
up against the rising tide of racist police violence.
On Saturday 28th September 1985, Mrs Cherry Groce, an innocent black
woman, was shot and paralysed, at her home, by armed police, supposedly
conducting 'routine inquiries'.
On Saturday 5th October, Mrs Cynthia Jarrett, another innocent black
mother, died as a result of a police raid on her home.
In both cases, the anger and the frustration felt by the local community led to
spontaneous uprisings.
The experiences of black people of the police are bitter, as testified by the
cases of the Bradford 12, Winston Rose, Colin Roach, the Newham 7, Junior
Service, Eustace Pryce..
