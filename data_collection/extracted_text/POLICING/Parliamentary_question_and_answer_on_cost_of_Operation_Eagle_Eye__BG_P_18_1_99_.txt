Written No. 149
Mr Bernie Grant (Tottenham): To ask the Secretary of State
for the Home Department, what estimate he has made of the
cost of Operation Eagle Eye. (38867)
MR MACLEAN
[holding answer 22 July 1996]
I understand from the Commissioner that during
1995/96, £4.8 million was spent on vehicles, technology and
training in support of Operation Eagle Eye which is one of
the agreed priorities for the Metropolitan Police.
Actual personnel costs for 1995/96 are not available
but the Commissioner estimates that personnel costs for
Operation Eagle Eye for 1996/97 will be £17.1 million.
