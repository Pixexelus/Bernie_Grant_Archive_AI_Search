Nor has anyone ever been prosecuted for
the 'hit lists' of political opponents
regularly published in Bulldog and National
Front News.
Giving the police new powers of search
and seizure and widening the law to cover
material published within an association, as
proposed in the White Paper, will not make
the slightest bit of difference if the
authorities maintain their unwillingness to
prosecute.
They shall pass
Given the reluctance of the state to outlaw
fascist activity or to create a climate which
does not make racism respectable, or to
impose bans which don't rebound on us,
anti-fascists have increasingly been forced
have been forcibly restrained by the police
or, more often, treated as the aggressors. (It
was in this way that Kevin Gately and Blair
Peach met their deaths.)
The message has been: Yes, they can pass
and you can pass, so long as it's another
place and another time. But the police have
not had the force of law behind them. Now,
with the new legislation, they will have. Our
right to defend our communities against the
fascists, to tell them simply what we think
of their behaviour, has been eroded by the
police year after year. Now the law wants
finally to make our activities (including
spontaneous protests of local citizenry)
illegal, to give the police the power to arrest
and charge us. The new law effectively says
that when the police deem it 'They shall
pass'.

Battle of Cable Street, the anti-fascist
tradition in Britain has been built around
the idea that 'They shall not pass'. It was
demonstrated in 1976, when black people
defended Manningham and Bolton, in
Tottenham, Lewisham and Ladywood in
1977 and in Southall in 1979.
And every time anti-fascists have tried to
prevent fascists from flaunting their racist
filth and terrorising black areas, the police
have intervened either to sidetrack us or,
when that failed, to beat us down. In
Tottenham, we could meet in a local park
whilst the fascists took to the High Road; in
Lewisham we could hold a morning march
along a different route from the fascists'
afternoon one; at Southall a delegation was
allowed to the Town Hall hours before the
fascists met.

repressive measures. At the same time, it
has used its legislative powers and control
over policing to undermine the democratic
institutions and traditions that form a base
The Public Order White Paper represents
the greatest threat to political rights in this
country since Thatcher's Government came
to power in 1979. Under the pretence of
dealing more effectively with problems such
as football hooliganism, the White Paper is,
in fact, aimed at dismantling our rights of
assembly, demonstrations and marches and
our ability to defend our communities
against increasing state repression.
Mass protest
=
'terrorism'
The White Paper is a further massive step
towards authoritarianism in Britain. Just as
the Tories seek to shift the whole of the
economy back to free market principles,
they are using their power and support in
the media to redefine the meaning of
political liberties. Thus, the individual
'liberties' of Ray Honeyford, Eddie Shah,
Victoria Gillick and working miners are to
be upheld at all costs; but their opponents
are cast as the oppressors 'the enemy
within' and their use of the basic rights
of mass protest and collective action
portrayed as a form of political terrorism.
A Government-created 'crisis'
In the process, the media turn a blind eye to
government policies that have actually
created a supposed 'law and order crisis'.
The struggles of the Greenham peace
women, for example, were provoked by the
Government when it brought American
cruise missiles to Britain. It was the
Government's enforcing of pit closures that
led to the miners' strike. And it was the
economic and social policies of the
Government that brought about the urban
uprisings of 1981 while the official neglect
of racist activity has made struggles like
that around the Newham 7 inevitable.

Police as surveillance weapon
More importantly, the Government
extended its use of the police as a political
weapon. Since the uprisings of 1981, squads
with an instant response capacity have been
formed all over the country to control
public order situations. And there has also
been a major increase in political
surveillance. For instance, a new Central
Intelligence Unit has been set up to keep

Police as political weapon

In recent years, the police have stretched
their existing legal powers to the limit in
order to suppress political protest. During
the miners' strike, powers to prevent
breaches of the peace were used to turn
pickets back on public roads hundreds of
miles from their destinations, while such
offences as riot and affray were used
arbitrarily to effect
arrests of
demonstrating miners and their supporters.

In protests over the Newham 7 case, the
police were able, through force of numbers
and riot equipment, to prevent
demonstrations from following their
planned routes. And in the recent operation
at Stonehenge, virtually a whole area of the
country was placed out-of-bounds to

Extending police repression
ni od lliw
The White Paper proposals will legitimate
and extend these repressive police practices.
Under the guise of clarifying and codifying
the law on riot, violent disorder, affray
(under which some of the Newham 7 were
recently convicted) and threatening
behaviour, the police will be able to
criminalise a much wider range of actions
and the authorities will be given far greater
discretion in pursuing prosecutions. This is
significant because, in the past, many of
these charges have failed to stick (for
instance, in the Bradford 12 and Newham 7
cases, charges of conspiracy were dropped
largely as a result of community pressure,
and recently, riot charges against the miners
have failed to stick). With an eye to the
experience of the miners' strike, increases in
penalties and police powers are proposed in
relation to the ancient offence of 'watching
and besetting' a person's home or work
place. Yet, no explanation has been given
of why this offence has not been used by the
police to control racial harassment; nor is
there any indication that it will be so used in
the future! Instead, the White Paper
suggests a further new offence of
disorderly behaviour', supposedly for
dealing with racist thugs; but the offence is
cast so widely as to constitute a revival of
the 'sus' laws primarily used against black
youths in the past.
