Dear Mr. Cohen,
I am writing personally to inform you of the setting up of the
Broadwater Farm Inquiry, and to appeal to you, and to the Comm-
ittee of which you are Secretary, to contribute evidence to us.
I enclose details of the terms of reference of the Inquiry and
of the members of the Inquiry panel. We want to work with all
sections of the community, and with all relevant organisations,
to establish the underlying causes of the the terrible events
of 6th October 1986, and to make constructive recommendations.
In the first instance, I hope that your Committee would wish to
present written evidence, both as to the background to the dis-
turbances and as to the way forward for the future. In the
month of May there will be oral hearings, at which representat-
ives of your Committee will be invited to give evidence.
I would be happy to meet you informally to discuss some of the
or to attend a meeting of your committee.
issues,
My colleagues and I ask for your co-operation in our difficult
task.
Yours sincerely,
Tous Gui
Lord Gifford
