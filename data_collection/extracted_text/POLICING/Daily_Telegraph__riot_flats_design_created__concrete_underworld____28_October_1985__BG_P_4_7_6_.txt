Riot flats design
created 'concrete
underworld'
AN
N architect has claimed that the design-
ers of Broadwater Farm Estate, scene
of the Tottenham riot, created a concrete
66
underworld
where crime thrived
and thousands of
council tenants have
lived for years in
misery.
The accusation of "bad
architecture" was made
in BUILDING DESIGN by Mr
Jim Sneddon, who lived
on the North London
estate for two years while
employed by Haringey's
housing and architects'
department.
Broadwater Farm was built
in 1971 by Taylor Woodrow
Associates to a 1960s design
by Haringey Council
architects.
many reinforced with steel plate
to deter the housebreaker."
Mr Sneddon claimed Broad-
water Farm had been planned in
homage to Le Corbusier, French
master of 1930s modernism, but
in Haringey the result had been
"a romantic and superficial
vision of the future" rather than
a serious attempt to create
homes.
He said water penetration
through flat roofs was so great
that it caused lighting circuits to
short.
Poor sound insulation between
the flats meant neighbours' con-
versations could be overheard,
even when separated by an
empty room.
'Desperate people'
"Worst of all was the external
acoustics of the estate. Any
noises, a party or a car alarm,
would reverberate around the
walkways and blocks to disturb
most of the inhabitants.
Mr Sneddon, a member of the
Royal Institute of British Archi-
tects community architecture Mr Sneddon said cockroaches,

He said the design feature
most criticised by tenants was
the raising up of the entire estate
on massive concrete stilts.
'Muggers' paradise'
"This single element has pos-
sibly been the most socially dam-
aging as it physically created a
concrete 'underworld' for crime
to thrive.
"Badly lit and overlooked by
nothing, these 'dark arches'
became a muggers' paradise.
Tenants became afraid to ven-
ture out after dark.
"Security began and ended at
the tenants' own front door,
"It naturally followed that
only those in the most dire need
of accommodation moved to the
estate.
"It was, and is, not uncommon
for these desperate people to
have additional problems such as
unemployment, broken mar-
riages or illness, forcing them to
accept housing they would other-
wise refuse.
"The estate and tenants
became branded as a 'problem'
with the resault that the area
became socially blighted. Ten-
ants found it hard to obtain
credit or even rent a colour tele-
vision solely because of their
address.
