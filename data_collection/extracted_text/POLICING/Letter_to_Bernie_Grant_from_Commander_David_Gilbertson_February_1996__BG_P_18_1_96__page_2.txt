perceived, rightly or wrongly, to be insincere. In all my dealings with you insincerity is
not a charge that could be laid at your door. May I suggest that as soon as my

Sharon and yourself could join us for lunch in order that I can make the necessary
introductions.
Yours sincerely,
David GILBERTSON
