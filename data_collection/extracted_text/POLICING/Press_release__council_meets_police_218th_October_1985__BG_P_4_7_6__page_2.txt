He defended the forcible entry into property and would not give
an undertaking that Council staff would be contacted before
forcible entries were made.
However, on the Council's part we will discuss fully the
police requests for assistance with their current inquiries
at Broadwater Farm and other policing matters in Haringey.
We hope that the initiative of this meeting will lead in
time to positive responses from the police to community needs.
We made clear our commitment to consultation with the police
over the establishment of a consultative committee and our
panel of Councillors will meet with D.A.C.Richards for
further discussions.
Haringey Council is determined to foster better community and
police relations, and at our suggestion there will be a
further meeting in two weeks time."
