"MR SEY WAS A FIT YOUNG MAN, WHO HAD PLAYED FOOTBALL FOR
THE GAMBIAN NATIONAL TEAM. IT BEGGARS BELIEF THAT HE
INVOLUNTARILY DIED OF A HEART ATTACK WHILE HE HAPPENED TO
BE IN POLICE CUSTODY. THE ALLEGED USE OF CS GAS IS ONLY ONE
QUESTION TO BE ANSWERED IN THIS CASE, AND WE AWAIT THE
RESULT OF THE INDEPENDENT POST MORTEM COMMISSIONED BY THE
FAMILY."
"I HAVE WRITTEN TO SIR PAUL CONDON TODAY ASKING FOR THE
POLICE OFFICERS INVOLVED IN THIS CASE TO BE SUSPENDED FROM
DUTY WHILE THE ENQUIRY IS CONDUCTED. I AM SATISFIED THAT THE
ISSUES ARISING FROM MR SEY'S DEATH WARRANT THE IMMEDIATE
REMOVAL OF OFFICERS FROM DUTY. "
