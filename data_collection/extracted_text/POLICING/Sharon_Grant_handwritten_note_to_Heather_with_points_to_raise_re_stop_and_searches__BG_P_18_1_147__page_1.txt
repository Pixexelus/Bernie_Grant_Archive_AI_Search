HOUSE OF COMMONS
LONDON SW1A OAA
2/2/95.
Dear Heacher,
Sorry to see
you
+ Starch figures
WAS
didn't cover the Stop
in Tomorrow's
WE sent last week. Perhaps
you come do so today on the strength of the EncloST
figures just received (& prorished
Hansard) in reply to Bemie's Parliamentary Question.
Interestingly, in this version of the figures the Ethnic
categories have been changed - we think to avoid the
Embarrassing use of the word 'Negroid' in the Police
version!
Main points are
The huge variation in the ust
in different areas of London
Ð³
of Stop Seara
2 The disproportionate no of Hacks being stopped
in some areas.
