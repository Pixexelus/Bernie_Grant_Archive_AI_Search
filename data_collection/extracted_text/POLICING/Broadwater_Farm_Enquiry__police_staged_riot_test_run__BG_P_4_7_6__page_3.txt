Said Mr. Stafford Scott, "If you go and tell your friends, 'I
was stopped and searched today, they won't all say 'Oh
that's terrible.' because they actually know it's a mundane
subject now.'
Asked whether the riot would have happened if Mrs. Jarrett
had not died, Mr. Scott replied: "If Mrs Jarrett hadn't
died, none of you would have been here speaking to us. This
would not have happened.'
Speaking of Mrs. Jarrett's death, Mr. Scott said that the
death of anybody in 'those kinds of circumstances' would have
caused some kind of reaction. "The fact that she was a
mother was important because historically black people have
always been matriarchal."
It was mundane for black youth to be stopped
be stopped and searched.
said Mr.
Mr. Scott "So when a black youth hears that a black
mother died as the result of her son being stopped and
searched for an out of date tax disc and the police then go
to her house and she dies, it is very easy for that youth to
transfer what happened to Floyd Jarrett to themselves."
"So on this day, when first people heard it, it was very easy
to actually transfer that it wasn't Mrs Jarrett and it wasn't
Floyd Jarrett, it was me,
Stafford Scott and my mum, Mrs.
Scott, and that it is how the community felt and that's why
everybody suddenly poured into the community."
