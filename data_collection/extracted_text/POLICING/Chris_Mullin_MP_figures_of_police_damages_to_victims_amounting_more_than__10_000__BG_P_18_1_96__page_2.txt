Dear Mr Mullin
The Commissioner has asked me to forward the details requested in
your letter of 4th April concerning civil actions against the
Metropolitan Police Service.
During 1993 and 1994 there were a total of 48 cases where damages
or settlement was for Â£10,000 or more. However, in 32 of these
cases there is no record of a formal complaint being made under
Of the remainder, four
the Police and Criminal Evidence Act.
cases resulted in disciplinary proceedings against officers.
These are as follows:
i. In 1993 one officer cautioned and another fined.
ii. In 1994 two separate cases where individual officers were
given words of advice.
iii. Additionally in 1994, one case involving a further payment,
where the original matter was completed in 1992 and seven
officers were dismissed at that time.
I do hope that this answers your enquiry.
Yours sincerely
Marz. Baggott
