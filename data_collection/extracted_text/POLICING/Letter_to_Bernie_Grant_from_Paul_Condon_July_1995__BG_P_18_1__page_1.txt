I appreciate that at the end of July you will be starting a well-
earned break from your many commitments, but if you are to be in
London on 28 July and can find the time, I would be very grateful
if you could attend a briefing by me at 10 am at New Scotland
Yard.
The following week, Thursday 3 August, I shall be launching an
important police operation to combat street robbery and I think it
is important to tell you about it.
When I talk about crime figures, I always add a health warning to
the effect that we should really simply use them to identify
trends. In London over the last two years, the trend has shown a
reduction in reported crime. However, within that trend there is
another which gives me cause for concern. That is that crimes of
violence against people showed a marked and unacceptable increase.
Most crimes of violence are committed by people who are well known
to their victims, but there is a worrying upward trend in the
number of street robberies - the kind of offence we generally call
mugging and which nearly always involves some form of violence.
