In four districts - City of London, Sur-
rey, Staffordshire and Gwent the figure
for black and ethnic minorities stopped was
three times higher and in West Mercia four
times higher than the proportion of local
population that comes from black and eth-
nic minority communities.
Police stop and search
under
powers
section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evi-
dence Act 1984 replaced the discredited
'sus' laws. Under the Act a uniformed police
officer requires reasonable suspicion of find-
ing a stolen or prohibited item. The focus
is on burglary, street robbery, illicit drug
use and carrying offensive weapons.
The London and
national figures
raise legitimate
concerns about
the use of stop
and search
against black
people
The Act also requires the police to col-
lect and publish statistics monitoring their
use of stop and searches powers. These
powers were increased under the Criminal
Justice and Public Order Act 1994 which
allows the police to stop and search any
person or vehicle for dangerous instruments
in an area where 'incidents involving seri-
ous violence may take place'.
No element of reasonable suspicion is
required and a refusal to co-operate is a
criminal offence.
Despite heavy reliance on stop and search
only a small number actually lead to arrest.
In 1993, only 13 per cent of the 442,800
people stopped and searched were actually
arrested.
A report compiled last year by crimi-
nologist Jock Young showed that in the
Finsbury Park area of North London there
was evidence of greater involvement of black
people in street crime than in burglary and
drugs-related offences. But the report
stressed that as street crimes are more likely
to be reported by the public it would be
for the police to determine the
pat-

*Based on the 1991 census **In these areas the police division and the local authority boundaries do not
exactly coincide. In these instances it may be misleading to compare the number of black people stopped and
searched and their proportion in the population. - These figures were not available
tern of
profile.
stop and searches on a street crime
Class shed some light on why some
groups were more likely to be stopped than
others. For example, Asians and Africans in
the area tended to be professionals or stu-
dents. Hence, more Irish people, who tended
to be working class, were stopped.
However, though many Afro-
Caribbeans were middle-class, a dispropor-
tionate number were stopped. The report
concluded this was "because their appear-
ance generates suspicion in terms of the
stereotypes held by the police".
The London figures provide the first
large-scale evidence that black people, par-
ticularly of Afro-Caribbean origin, are more
likely than people from other ethnic groups
to be stopped and searched. Furthermore,
the higher rates of black searches in bor-
oughs with smaller black communities may
be interpreted as direct or at least indirect
evidence of police discrimination.
It would be foolish to intrpret police
actions directly from either the London or
national figures. However, the figures do
raise legitimate concerns about the use of
stop and search against black people. Fur-
thermore, given the low rate of arrests that
follow stop and searches, equally legitimate
questions are raised about the effectiveness
of this police strategy to fight crime.
