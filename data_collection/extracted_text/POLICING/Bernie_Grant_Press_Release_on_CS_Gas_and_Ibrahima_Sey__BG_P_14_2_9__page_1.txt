PRESS RELEASE FROM BERNIE GRANT MP
22/3/96
CS GAS - PUT CAMERAS IN POLICE VANS & STATIONS NOW
BERNIE GRANT TODAY DEMANDED THE IMMEDIATE INSTALLATION OF
VIDEO CAMERAS IN POLICE VANS, YARDS, CELLS AND CHARGE ROOMS
AFTER THE DEATH OF 29 YEAR OLD IBRAHIMA SEY LAST WEEKEND AT
ILFORD POLICE STATION. HE HAS ALSO DEMANDED THE SUSPENSION
OF THE FOREST GATE POLICE OFFICERS INVOLVED, PENDING THE
OUTCOME OF THE ENQUIRY INTO HIS DEATH.
AFTER SPENDING SOME HOURS WITH MR SEY'S FAMILY THIS WEEK,
MR GRANT SAID THAT THERE WERE SERIOUS GROUNDS FOR CONCERN
ABOUT THE POLICE HANDLING OF THE CASE, AND ABOUT EVENTS AT
ILFORD POLICE STATION ON THE NIGHT OF MR SEY'S DEATH. HE ALSO
CRITICISED POLICE NEWS MANAGEMENT OF THE CASE.
"THE POLICE WERE CALLED TO MR BEY'S HOME BECAUSE HE WAS
BEHAVING IN A DISTURBED MANNER. AFTER BEING CALMED DOWN,
MR SEY'S FAMILY ASKED FOR HIM TO BE TAKEN TO HOSPITAL.
INSTEAD HE WAS TAKEN TO ILFORD POLICE STATION, WHERE HE WAS
APPARENTLY MANHANDLED IN THE YARD, AND DIED WITHIN
MINUTES."
"MR SEY'S BODY WAS THEN TAKEN TO HOSPITAL WHERE A FRIEND
SAW IT ARRIVE. SHE HAS TOLD ME SHE WAS THREATENED BY POLICE
AND DOCTORS NOT TO REVEAL HE WAS DEAD ON ARRIVAL. THIS
EPISODE IS REMINISCENT OF THE CASE OF JOY GARDNER."
"HAD THERE BEEN VIDEO CAMERAS IN THE POLICE VAN, AND THE
YARD, WE MIGHT HAVE HAD A CHANCE OF FINDING OUT THE TRUTH
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO MR SEY. AS THINGS STAND, GIVEN THE
RECORD OF FUDGE AND COVER UP ON BLACK DEATHS IN CUSTODY IT
IS LIKELY THAT WE SHALL NEVER KNOW THE TRUTH."
