Buckley Hall is, however, currently above the average on time
out of cell, and hours of purposeful activity. They also recorded a
lower than average rate of assaults on staff for the first two months
of this year.
The prison is also performing to a high standard in tackling
offending behaviour, incentives relating to prisoner behaviour, and
pre-release work.
Ms Lynne: To ask the Secretary of State for the Home
Department if he will list the key performance indicators
as stipulated in the contract awarded to Group 4 for the
117 running of Buckley Hall prison, and if he will publish the
statistics in respect of which performance indicators have
been met since the prison opened.

Letter from Richard Tilt to Ms Liz Lynne, dated
29 March 1996:
The Home Secretary has asked me to reply to your recent
Question about key performance indicators as stipulated in the
contract awarded to Group 4 for the running of Buckley Hall prison
Under the contract awarded to Group 4 for the management of
Buckley Hall prison the contractor's performance is assessed against
120 criteria. I have arranged for a copy of the performance system
to be placed in the Library.
Performance is measured over periods of 12 months with the
first performance year running from 14 December 1994. The Prison
Service and Group 4 are currently reviewing performance for this
period against the criteria and 1 will write to the hon. Member when
that work has been completed.
