Criminalisation of political dissent
In much the same way as Leon Brittan
recently intervened to stop the broadcast on
the BBC of an elected Sinn Fein
representative's views, the police in each
locality will be able to determine which
marches can proceed and the conditions
under which a whole range of political
activity marches, demos, pickets and
outdoor meetings can take place. By
imposing fines of up to £1,000, and possible
prison sentences, on the organisers of
demonstrations which fail to comply with
police regulations, the state will effectively
write into the statute book the
criminalisation of political dissent.

Dividing the community and
Although technically the White Paper's
proposals could have an impact on the civil
liberties of everyone, the most serious effect
will be in intimidating spontaneous protest
loq
and collective community organisation and
making it easier for the police to target
'ringleaders' and well-known community
figures.
What the Paper promises to do so
effectively is to divide groups who will work
with the police from those who will not, or
simply cannot, work with the police
because the only coherent and effective
'At one end of the spectrum are
the terrorist gangs within our
borders and the terrorist states
which arm them. At the other are
the hard Left, operating inside our
system, conspiring to use union
power and the apparatus of local
government to break, defy and
subvert the laws.' (Margaret
Thatcher)
off in an immigration raid, wait seven days
before mounting a protest?
Criminalising community concern
The police will not only decide what
constitutes legitimate political activity, but
they will also determine when, where and
how you relate to your particular
community. It is alright if you channel your
dissent, your sense of community concern,
through police-initiated programmes such
as neighbourhood watch, victim support or
crime prevention schemes. (And it has
actually been part of the new policing
strategy to co-opt

means of opposition they have is that of
spontaneous self-organisation. How can
the Irish community, which is subject to
intimidatory police raids on their homes, or
the black community, which has just seen a
member harassed on the streets or carted
more and more
community groups and individuals into
their so-called community policing.) But
once you step outside these official
channels, once you question their validity
or try to defend the community against
fascist incursion, police harassment,
government cuts in housing, educational or
welfare provision, you run the risk (under
the proposed legislation) of becoming the
'enemy within'. And you will become
subject to the full force of the state's new
powers of repression and control.

Various organisations get together to hold a
demonstration in protest at racial attacks in
their area. They contact the police to give
them advance notice. The police say that
the march can go ahead, but impose the
condition that it must avoid all the main
roads and shopping areas and keep to the
quiet residential back streets. The reason
for this, they say, is 'to prevent serious
disruption to the local community'.
Then, police intelligence officers hear
from police informers that at least 1,000
people are expected to demonstrate. The
recently appointed and rather nervous local
police chief seeks and obtains a ban on the
march the morning it is due to take place.
He warns those organising the
demonstration that if it goes ahead they
could go to prison for up to three months
and that anyone simply taking part could be
fined up to £400. At a rally hastily
organised to replace the march, scuffles
break out between protesters and the
police. Police with dogs and riot equipment
appear and the violence escalates.
The organisers of the original
demonstration are charged with riot, the
police claiming that they were threatening
unlawful violence with a common purpose;
many protesters are charged with affray,
also because, the police claim, they
threatened or used unlawful violence, and
some of these do not have the chance to put
their case before a jury but are tried before

Pickets are outside a factory that has
consistently paid low wages and has a
record of bad safety regulations. Police
move the picket away from the main gate of
the factory, allow no one to come and join
the picket who cannot prove to them,
beyond their definition of reasonable
doubt, that they are current employees of
the factory. (Those excluded from the
picket therefore include those the
employers have dismissed since the strike
action began.) The picket is limited to six
people, and is only allowed to begin at 6pm
and to continue for no more than one hour,
because the police argue that the picket
constitutes a disruption of the factory's
legitimate activities and could coerce
individuals to join the picket.

A scuffle takes place in the street when
police question some black youths about
their movements at the time of a recent
reported 'mugging' and two of the youths
are bundled into a police van and taken to
the local station. Local residents, enraged
by the incident and aware that the youths
will probably be charged with assaulting the
police, march on the police station. All
those on the march are detained and
questioned as to who organised it. The
police also make use of information
gathered from other local residents,
including gossip picked up by police
officers on patrol and in neighbourhood
watch meetings. A number of alleged
'ringleaders' are charged with failing to give
police advance notice of the demonstration.
If convicted, they could face a fine of up to
£400.
Tenants go on a rent strike to protest at the
appalling state of maintenance on their
estate. Police are given notice of a
demonstration. However, on the day, they
arrive in substantial numbers and say that it
constitutes a disruption of community life,
because it is taking place in a residential
area and will be disturbing those tenants
who are not on the march. They therefore
redirect the march to the park, instead of
outside the nearby council offices, and
allow only 10 people to march instead of
the intended number. Any others who
attempt to join the march are arrested and
are variously charged with affray, violent
disorder and disorderly conduct.

and the anti-fascist movement.
The Public Order Act of 1936 was passed
not so much because of meetings and
marches of Mosley's blackshirts, as because
their activities were being physically
opposed by anti-fascists on the streets. The
famous Battle of Cable Street, with its
slogan 'They shall not pass', in which anti-
fascists defended London's East End
Jewish community from fascist incursion,
was the background to that Act.

Similarly, the 'insulting words and
behaviour' section of the existing Act has
become a standard police tool on any
demonstration or political march. Indeed,
one of the first victims of the section was an
anti-fascist arrested for whistling during a
fascist rally in Stepney Green in 1937.
Single bans are already possible
The authorities have often claimed that
their having to treat both the Left and the
Right equally was not so much because of
political commitment (or rather, a
commitment to non-commitment) as
because they had no power to ban
particular marches or marches around a
particular issue. In fact, it is argued that the
new legislation which will allow for the
single ban is progressive.
But a closer look shows that the state has
always had that power, but has chosen to
use it very selectively. For example, in 1961
a ban was imposed on any demonstration
called by the 'ban the bomb' Committee of
100; in 1963 a ban was imposed on political
marches in the St Pancras area of London
where a rent strike was going on, and in
1974 a ban was imposed in the West
Midlands on any demonstration in
connection with IRA hunger strikers.

Failure to use incitement

Even the incitement to racial hatred
provisions of the Race Relations Acts have
been little used against fascists. In fact, five
of the earliest prosecutions were against
black power militants. And the present law,
supposedly strengthened in 1976 so as to
prosecute incitement whether intentional or
not, has resulted in only 20 prosecutions,
despite the upsurge of fascist activity and
wide distribution of blatantly racist
materials.
