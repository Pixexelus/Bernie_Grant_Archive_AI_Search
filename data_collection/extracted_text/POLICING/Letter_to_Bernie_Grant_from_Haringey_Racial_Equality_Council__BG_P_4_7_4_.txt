Dear Mr Grant,
RE: TOTTENHAM - STOP AND SEARCH STATISTICS
Thank you for your correspondence dated 2nd February 1995 and the detailed figures for Stop
and Search across London Metropolitan Areas.
-
We agree that the terminology used is offensive; "Negroid Types", "Indian and Pakistani
Types" what is a type? (a "type" of car?). Surely in light of all the years of community
policing and racial awareness training that the police have undergone that it is lamentable that
they are unable to come up with a more sensitive and less insulting categorisation.
The high number of Stop and Searches conducted on African and African-Caribbean peoples
in Haringey is cause for serious concern and we observe that the same pattern follows for
Boroughs where there is a large Indian and Pakistani community. We would hope that other
MPS and RECS share the same concern.
I can assure you that we have not let this matter drop and that the issue of the figures for
Stop and Search in both Hornsey/Wood Green, and Tottenham were highlighted at Haringey
REC's General Council Meeting on Wednesday 15th February 1995. The police are aware of
this and it is the intention of this Council to seek a meeting, in the near future, with both
Superintendents from Tottenham and Hornsey Divisions with a view to hear what action has
been taken to address this matter.
It was kind of you to invite the Chief Officer and myself to the meeting, at the Haringey
Community and Police Consultative Group offices, to meet and discuss the issue with police
officers and others in attendance.
I also note that it is your birthday today - please accept my belated congratulations and best
wishes.
Yours sincerely
Eddie
