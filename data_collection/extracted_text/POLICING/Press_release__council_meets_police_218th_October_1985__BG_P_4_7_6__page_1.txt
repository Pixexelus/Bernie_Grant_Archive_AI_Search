COUNCIL MEETS POLICE
18th October 1935
The Leader of Haringey Council, Cllr Bernie Grant, issued
the following statement on Thursday October 17th:
"Leading Councillors met with Deputy Assistant Commissioner
Richards and his senior officers this evening to establish
some dialogue on the events at Broadwater Farm since
October 6th and the future policing of this area.
We had hoped to get some assurances from the police that they
would not seek a high level presence tomorrow at Mrs Jarrett's
funeral. I am pleased to say that D.A.C. Richards is committed
to respecting the emotions of local people concerning the
funeral, and would ensure no inteference, no vehicles along the
route and no house to house enquiries on Broadwater Farm on
Friday.
We stressed our concern at the continuing high levels of
policing on the estate and some of the methods of enquiry
being used, which are causing distress to a number of residents.
We were disappointed that D.A.C. Richards saw a high level of
policing as necessary for the foreseeable future, despite
accepting that there had been absolutely no incidents of crime
or harassment of the police since the night of October 6th.
D.A.C.Richards would not accept the problems created by some
questioning, including asking the country of origin of residents,
but would take back our concern at the questioning of young
children.
