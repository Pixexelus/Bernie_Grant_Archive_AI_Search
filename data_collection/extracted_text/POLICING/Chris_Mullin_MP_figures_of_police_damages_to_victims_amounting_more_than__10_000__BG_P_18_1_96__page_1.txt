I recently asked the Metropolitan Commissioner to supply me
with details of claims against his force with had resulted in
settlements or payment of damages amounting to £10,000 or more.
I also asked for details of disciplinary action taken against
police officers involved in these cases. Please find enclosed
a copy of his answer which covers the period 1993-94.
