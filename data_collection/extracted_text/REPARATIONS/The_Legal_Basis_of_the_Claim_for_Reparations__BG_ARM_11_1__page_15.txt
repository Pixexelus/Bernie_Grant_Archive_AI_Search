appraising the issue of reparations in
relation to the damage done to Africa

reparations is an important question
requiring the united action of Africa
and its Diaspora and worthy of the
active support of the rest of the
international community;
Fully persuaded that the damage
sustained by the African peoples is
not a "thing of the past" but is painfully
manifest in the damaged lives of
contemporary Africans from Harlem to
Harare, in the damaged economies of
the Black World from Guinea to
Guyana, from Somalia to Surinam;
Respectfully aware of historic
precedents in reparations, ranging
from German payment of restitution to
the Jews for the enormous tragedy of

Cognizant of the fact that
compensation for injustice need not
necessarily be paid only in capital br
transfer but could include services to
the victims or other forms of restitution
and readjustment of the relationship
agreeable to both parties; ab
Emphatically convinced that what

traditional treasures to restore them to
their rightful owners the African

owed to the African peoples which
has yet to be paid - the debt of
compensation to the Africans as the
most humiliated and exploited people
of the last four centuries of modern
Calls upon Heads of States and
Governments in Africa and the
Diaspora itself to set up National
Committees for the purpose of
studying the damaged Black
experience, disseminating information
and encouraging educational courses
on the impact of Enslavement,
colonization and neo-colonialism on
present-day Africa and its Diaspora.
Urges the Organization of African
Unity to grant observer status to

monetary payment of reparations
through capital transfer and debt

reparations is well grounded in
