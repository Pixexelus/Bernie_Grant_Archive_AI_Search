movement;
Serves notice on all states in Europe
and the Americas which had
participated in the enslavement and
colonization of the African peoples,
and which may still be engaged in
racism and neo-colonialism, to desist
from any further damage and start
building bridges of conciliation, co-
operation, and through reparations.
Exhorts all African states to grant
entrance as of right to all persons of
Africans descent and right to obtain
residence in those African states, if
there is no disqualifying element on
the African claiming the "right to
return" to his ancestral home Africa;
Urges those countries which were
enriched by slavery and the slave
trade to give total relief from Foreign
Debt, and allow the debtor countries
of the diaspora to become free for
self-development and from immediate
and direct economic domination.
Calls upon the countries largely
characterised as profiteers from the
slave trade to support proper and
andenps
reasonable representation of African
Peoples in the political and economic
areas of the highest decision-making
bodies.
Requests the OAU to intensify its
efforts in restructing the international
system in pursuit of justice with
special reference to a permanent
African seat on the Security Council of
the U.N.
