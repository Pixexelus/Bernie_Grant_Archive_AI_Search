Even after the independence of
Africans nations from colonialism,
the shackles of neo-colonialism have
fettered the power of African
governments to speak with any real
independence for a claim for
reparations to be voiced. Indeed I
would argue that now, as never
before, is the right time for this claim
to be made, as African leaders are
speaking with a new confidence and
operating new democratic structures.
4. THE CLAIM WOULD BE
BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF ALL
I do not hold any such defeatist view.
Once the first three propositions are
accepted as valid, and the right to
reparations is seen to be soundly
established in international law, then
ways of doing justice can and will be
found. Difficulties of scale or
procedures should not be obstacles
to justice. The unwillingness of the
white world to consider the claim is
not a reason for giving it up, but
rather a spur to mobilizing
awareness and support around the
issues.
However, in addressing these
AFRICANS, IN AFRICA AND IN THE questions I seek to identify the

S
o far I have been dealing with
the legal basis for the
reparations claim. The next
four sections deal with questions
which a legal analyst is bound to
raise, however difficult it is to answer
them:
Who are to be the Plaintiffs, or
claimants for reparations?
Who are to be the Defendants
against whom the claim is made?
What are the damages to be
claimed?
In what Court is the claim to be
brought?
ang
Here we sail into unchartered
waters, since no claim for
reparations of this magnitude has
ever been brought. Hundreds of
millions of people, in different
continents of the world, have an
interest in this claim. Their losses
may seem almost impossible to

daunted by the practical problems
involved that they conclude that the
claim is unrealistic.
principles involved, rather than to
furnish precise answers, which can
only be developed over time and
experience, and after deep study.
Who are the claimants for
reparations? The broad answer is
that all Africans, on the Continent of
Africa and in the Diaspora, who
suffer the consequences of the crime
of mass kidnap and enslavement,
have an interest in this claim.
All Africans around the world have
been affected in some way by the
crime of slavery. Even those who
have succeeded in a business or a
profession have had to face racial
prejudice at the least. And while
there may be some whose families
enriched themselves by collaboration
with the slavers, that should not be
allowed to undermine the overall
truth that the rape of Africa
impoverished all Africans, both those
who were taken and those who were
left behind.
Who should process the claim on
behalf of so many? This is a matter
which transcends national
governments - but governments are
the chief implementers of social
programmes, as well as being
responsible for the repayments of
their country's foreign debt. They
should neither be excluded from, nor
have sole control over, the
prosecution of the claim. In any
case, African-Americans, African
British, French Africans, and others
who are in a minority in the country
where they have settled, have no
government which could speak for
them.
Some form of appropriate,
representative and trustworthy body
will be required; its size and
composition, and the mechanisms
for setting it up, will become clearer
as the movement for reparations
develops.

W
ho is responsible for
paying reparations? Here
it is more appropriate to
concentrate on the Governments of
the countries which fostered and
supported the slave trade, which
legitimized the institution of slavery,
and which have profited as a result.
It would be possible to identify
individual companies which could be
proved to have made vast profits
from slavery. There are plantation
owners in Jamaica, and titled
families in England, whose living
heirs owe their wealth to slaving.
Should such companies and families
be targeted as individual Defendants
to a reparations claim?
In my view such an approach would
