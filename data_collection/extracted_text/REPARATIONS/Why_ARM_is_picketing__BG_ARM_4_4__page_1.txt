WHY A.R.M.
IS PICKETING
Just under one hundred years ago in 1897 a British expedition attacked Benin
City, the capital of an ancient and extensive Empire situated in present day
Nigeria. The British colonial army referred to the conflict as the "punitive
expedition" because earlier seven univited British officials and traders to that
region were ambushed and killed.
The Kingdom of Benin had a long history of peaceful relations with European
nations, but it was the desire of the British to control trade which led them to
attack this much admired African civilisation.
The Benins saw the 1897 event as an evil intrusion to their sovereignty and
annexation of the region by a foreign power. The then King Oba Ovonramwen
was subsequently deposed and sent into exile. Benin city, whose civilization
and and artefacts dates further back than the 13th century, was almost
completly destroyed. Sacred treasures discovered by the colonial army were
stripped from their rightful owners, and looted mainly to Britain and then to
other countries in the West.
When the looted art treasures were brought back to England many of the
military offices kept collections of their own and the Foreign Office sold
considerable quantities, much of which found it's way to the museums of
Europe and America.
The remarkable quality of the work was rapidly reflected, in high auction room
prices. The vast majority of the artifacts remain in private collections. The
Foreign Office gave the British Museum a huge quantity of bronze wall
plaques which depict the history of the Benin Empire in the 15th and 16th
centuries. Many are displayed particularly in ethnographic section of these
museums. The premier collection of these priceless Benin art treasures is held
today at the Museum of Mankind.
