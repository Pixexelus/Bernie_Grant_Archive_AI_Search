FACTS
on Reparations to Africa and Africans
in the Diaspora
REPRINTED BY PERMISSION OF THE HON. DUDLEY THOMPSON OJ QC RAPPORTEUR TO THE GROUP OF EMINENT PERSONS ON REPARATIONS
1. What is Reparations about?
There is an abundance of proof that
Africa was the cradle of civilization.
Centuries before the birth of Christ,
the stories of the Queen of Sheba
and her visits to King Solomon, with
an organised retinue and also the
architectural wonders of the
pyramids are clear evidence of the
height to which African civilization
had reached. Further the ancient
kingdoms of Africa like those of
Songhai, Benin, Ghana and others
were highly organized and even
ancient universities like Timbuktu
existed. At this time Europe was very
underdeveloped and America had
not even been discovered. This
development of Africa was
interrupted sometime around the
14th century by the heinous
institution of slavery. This robbed
Africa of her best and strongest men,
women and children who were put in
chains and were exported like goods
and chattels - like goats and pigs to
the Islands of the Caribbean, United
States, Brazil and elsewhere. These
slaves worked under very hard
conditions, planting sugar cane, and
cotton for their masters' enrichment
and this prevented for centuries the
development of their own countries
in Africa. The results of their work as
slaves was to enrich the countries of
their masters. Those countries
became rich and developed, while
Africa, the homes of the slaves,
remained poor.
Reparations which comes from the
word 'repair' is a Movement which
seeks to identify and redress those
wrongs, so that the countries and
people that suffered will enjoy full
freedom to continue their own
development on more equal terms.
2. How do you intend to go about
it?
There is a Sub-Committee which
was appointed after the first
International Conference on
Reparations in Lagos, Nigeria in
December, 1990. This Committee
has advanced the cause to the
national level and President Ibrahim
Babangida advanced it further to the
platform of the OAU which in June,
1992 empanelled a Group of
Eminent Persons (GEP) to work out
the different ways in which to
proceed, and to secure technical
advisers who will help to solve some
of the problems raised by this claim.
This Group also hopes to make this
cause known to the peoples of the
world in a quest for justice. This
information is being passed to you
now through this publication and

the demand on the agenda of the
United Nations, as it has now been
supported by the OAU.
4. Why are we asking so late?
to abmuong
This is not late for the following
reasons:
(i) There is no law of limitations
which limits claims for murder and
genocide, such as was involved in
slavery;
(ii) Further, when slavery was
abolished in the 1830s, it was
succeeded by colonialism. This did
not abolish exploitation of the
colonies, it was merely a
transformation from one subjugation
to another. Colonialism ended for
most of us only 30 years ago and in
fact this still exists in some colonies.
As colonies, we could not speak for
ourselves, as we were not free to do
so. Since the abolition of colonialism
just 30 years ago, we are free to
speak and are asking you to join us.
Thirty years is not a long time on the
pages of history.
It is the failure of development in
Africa over the last 30 years that has

The Group of Eminent Persons on
Reparations for slavery, operating
under the umbrella of the OAU, is a
structured body consisting of people
with international reputations and is
not restricted to one race, sex or

the black peoples of the world, and
we expect soon to be able to place

colonialism have remained as
shackles that need to be removed if
we are to be free to pursue
development.
