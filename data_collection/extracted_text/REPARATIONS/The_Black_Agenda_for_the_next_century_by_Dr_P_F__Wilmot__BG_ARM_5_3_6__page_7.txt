CAN AFRICA AND ITS SCATTERED CHILDREN SURVIVE ANOTHER
SUCH
SUCH CENTURY? NOT UNLESS WE UNDERSTAND THE HAZARDS OF THE PAST,
WHICH HAVE BEEN PERPETUATED INTO THE PRESENT. AFRICANS AT HOME
HAND ABROAD NEED TO REJECT DECISIVELY THE MASTER-SLAVE RELATIONS
20 IMPRINTED IN ALL OUR MINDS. WE NEED TO PUT OUR COLLECTIVE HOUSE
IN ORDER AND ACT AS ONE TO REMOVE THE OBSTACLES WHICH MAKE LIFE
HELL ON EARTH FOR ALL OF US. AFRICANS AT HOME AND ABROAD ARE
THROUGH
ONE PEOPLE, TORN APART BY HATE, INCLUDING SELF-HATE.
REPARATIONS THE WOUNDS MUST BE HEALED, AND MAN MADE ONE AGAIN.
THE OAU HAS ADOPTED REPARATIONS AND INVITED AFRICANS IN THE
ODIASPORA TO BE OBSERVERS AT ITS DELIBERATIONS.
MA 2008 ON THE CONTINENT THE MARCH TO DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT MUST
BE PURSUED WITH VIGOUR, AND WITHIN A PAN-AFRICAN CONTEXT. THERE
MUST BE NO CLOSED BORDERS IN AFRICA TO PEOPLE WHO WERE TORN FROM
HER SOIL. ADMINISTRATION AND ECONOMIC POLICIES MUST BEAR THE
HALLMARK OF HONESTRY, TRANSPARENCY AND INTEGRITY. AFRICA MUST
RID ITSELF OF THOSE WHO ACT LIKE SLAVE MASTERS AND COLONISTS,
TORTURING THEIR OWN PEOPLE AND LOOTING THEIR COUNTRIES. WHY
SHOULD AFRICANS TAKE THE BLAME FOR THE ATROCITIES CAUSED BY
MONSTERS CREATED BY EUROPE?
IN THE DIASPORA AFRICANS MUST RESCUE ITS LOST CHILDREN
WHO BEAR THE SEEDS OF THEIR FUTURE. THE DRUGS AND GUNS WHICH
FLOOD BLACK NEIGHBOURHOODS ARE THE SAME AS THE ALCOHOL AND
FIREARMS WHICH DEVASTATED AFRICA IN PAST CENTURIES. THEY ARE
NOT FROM THE BLACK GHETTOES OR AFRICA BUT THE DEATHS AND
DESTRUCTION THEY CAUSE ARE. WHAT FUTURE IS THERE FOR CRACK AND
GUNS BUT THE SCREAMS OF DEAD AND DYING, AND THE FINAL SILENCE OF
THE GRAVE?
IF THE PEOPLE OF AFRICA CAN SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE THEY CAN
TELL THEIR OPPRESSORS THAT THE END TO RACISM CAN COME ONLY WHEN
ITS ORIGINS ARE RECOGNISED, ACCEPTED AND ATONED FOR, THAT GOOD
RACE RELATIONS CANNOT EXIST ALONGSIDE BAD ECONOMIC, POLITICAL
AND CULTURAL RELATIONS. RACISM DOES NOT CONSIST ONLY IN
"LYNCHING NIGGERS" OR ABUSING "JUNGLE BUNNIES" BUT IN ACCEPTING
A SOCIAL ORDER WHICH CONDEMNS MILLIONS TO PREMATURE DEATHS, POOR
HEALTH, HOUSING, EDUCATION AND OTHER SOCIAL ILLS, SIMPLY BECAUSE
OF THE COLOUR OF THEIR SKINS. WHILE AMERICAN CITIZENS OF
EUROPEAN DESCENT ENJOY THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF LIVING IN THE
WORLD, AFRICAN-AMERICANS RANK 32ND, ALONGSIDE BARBADOS..
THE POVERTY OF THE AFRICAN IS CAUSED NOT BY GENES, WHICH
ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF OTHER RACES, BUT BY SOCIAL, ECONOMIC,
POLITICAL AND CULTURAL CONDITIONS DETERMINED BY HISTORICAL
DEVELOPMENTS OF THE PAST FIVE CENTURIES. WHAT WOULD IT COST THE
EUROPEANS, EVEN THOSE WHO ARE NOT CHILDREN OF SLAVE-MASTERS, TO
ACCEPT THIS AND SAY: "WE ARE SORRY?" THE LATE GERMAN CHANCELLOR
WILLY BRANDT, WHO APOLOGISED TO THE JEWISH PEOPLE FOR THE CRIMES
OF THE NAZIS WAS NOT A NAZI AND FOUGHT AGAINST THESE RACIST
MASS-MURDERERS. HE APOLOGISED NOT ONLY FOR THE SUFFERING OF THE
JEWISH PEOPLE BUT ALSO TO ENABLE THE GERMANS EXORCISE THEIR
SENSE OF GUILT AND EVIL, AND BE AT PEACE WITH THEMSELVES.
