1. THE ENSLAVEMENT
OF AFRICANS WAS A CRIME
AGAINST HUMANITY
T
words:
he Charter of the Nuremberg
Tribunal defined crimes
against humanity in these
Murder, extermination,
enslavement, deportation, and
other inhumane acts
committed against any civilian
population... whether or not
in violation of the domestic law of
the country where perpetrated.
The Charter also gave jurisdiction to
the Tribunal to try crimes against
Peace ('planning, preparation,
initiation or waging of a war of
aggression...), and War Crimes
('violation of the laws and customs of
war... including murder, ill-treatment,
or deportation to slave labour or for
any other purpose of civilian
populations of or in occupied
territory..')
It is considered by international
lawyers that the Nuremberg charter
did not create new law, but declared
and confirmed concepts of
international criminality which have
been accepted over centuries. As
one writer puts it:
The tribunal found that acts so
reprehensible as to offend the
conscience of mankind, directed
against civilian populations, are
crimes in international Law,
(D.P. O'Connell, International Law
for Students).
In 1948 the United Nations promoted
the Convention on the Prevention
and Punishment of the Crime of
Genocide. It has been ratified by
most countries in the world. Again,
the Convention was giving a new
legal form to an old concept in
international law. The preamble to
the Convention recognized that
"genocide is a crime against e
international law", and that "at all
periods of history genocide has
inflicted great losses on humanity".
Genocide was defined:
Genocide means any of the
following acts committed with intent
to destroy, in whole or in part, a
national, ethnical, racial or religious
group, as such:
(a) Killing members of the group;
(b) Causing serious bodily or
mental harm to members of
the group
(c) Deliberately inflicting on the
Ma group conditions of life
calculated to bring about its
physical destruction in whole
or in part...
Historians and other experts can
show without difficulty how the
invasion of African territories, the
mass capture of Africans, the horrors
of the middle passage, the
chattelization of Africans in the
Americas, the extermination of the
language and culture of the
transported Africans, constituted
violations of all these international
laws.
The arguments that such crimes
were 'legal' under European law, and
accepted as normal by most
Europeans, would be unavailing
Europeans did not, then or now,
constitute all mankind, and the
conscience of all decent mankind
must always have been outraged by
the atrocities which Europeans
inflicted on Africans for over 400
years.
Indeed it can be said that it was the
ultimate crime against humanity, to
deny human status to a vast section
of humankind.
2. INTERNATIONAL LAW
RECOGNIZES THAT THOSE WHO
COMMIT CRIMES AGAINST
HUMANITY MUST MAKE
REPARATION
T
he right to reparation is well
recognized in international
law. it has been defined
by
the Permanent Court of International
Justice (the predecessor of the
International Court of Justice) in
these terms:
The essential principle contained
in the actual notion of an illegal act
- a principle which seems to be
established by international
practice and in particular by the
decisions of arbitral tribunals - is
that reparation must, as far as
possible, wipe out all the
consequences of the illegal act
and reestablish the situation which
would, in all probability, have
existed if that act had not be
committed. Restitution in kind or, if
this is not possible, payment of a
sum corresponding to the value
which a restitution in kind
would bear; the award, if need be,
of damages for loss sustained
which would not be covered by
restitution in kind or payment in
place of it - such are the principles
which should serve to determine,
the amount of compensation due
for an act contrary to international
law. (Chorzow Factory Case,
Germany v Poland, 1928)
The leading textbook on international
law by Schwarzenberger described
the recognition of the right to
reparation as a process:
International judicial institutions
have slowly groped their way
towards the articulate formulation
of the rule that the commission of
an international tort (wrong) entails
the duty to make reparations.
