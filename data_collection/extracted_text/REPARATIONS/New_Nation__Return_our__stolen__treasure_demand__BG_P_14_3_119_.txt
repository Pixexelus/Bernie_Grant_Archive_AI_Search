Return our 'stolen'
treasure demand
rt lovers and historians
Agathered in London
last week to demand Bri-
tain returns hundreds of
treasures 'stolen from Afr-
ica a century ago.
The treasures, which are
housed in the British Mus-
eum, were taken from the
ancient kingdom of Benin,
mid-western Nigeria by pil-
laging British invaders.
Now a campaign has be-
en launched to not only
mark the 100th anniversary
of the 'theft' of the artifacts
but to exert pressure on the
Government and the art
establishment to return the
cultural heir looms to their
rightful home in Nigeria.

Tottenham MP, Bernie
Grant, who has thrown his
weight behind the Benin
campaigners said: 'I am
hopeful some of the stolen
works of art will soon be
returned from private
museums although it will
be much harder to get the
Edun, Prince of Benin (left) with stolen treasures
British Museum to return
its hoard of treasures bec-
ause of legal restrictions?
Lashing out at the British
establishment for the theft
of cultural and spiritual
icons, Benin national Mrs
Veralin Omogiafo, said: 'It's
our right to have these arti-
facts. The British don't
know what they mean to
us. It's like they've taken
our pride?
Anthony Aboiralor, Chai-
rman of the Edo State
Centenary said: 'We want
our artifacts back. We were
treated badly when the
British invaded Benin and
stole our sacred relics.
'We would like our
children to see these arti-
facts in Nigeria so they
will know that we Africans
were the originators of
arts?
