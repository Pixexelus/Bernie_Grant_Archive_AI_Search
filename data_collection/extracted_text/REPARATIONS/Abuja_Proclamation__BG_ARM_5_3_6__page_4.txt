Convinced that the claim for Reparations is well grounded
in International Law.
Urges on the OAU to establish a legal Committee on the issue
of Reparations.
Also calls upon African and Diaspora groups already working
on reparations to communicate with the Organization of African
Unity and establish continuing liaison;
Encourages such groups to send this declaration to various
countries to obtain their official support for the movement
Serves notice on all states in Europe and the Americas
which had participated in the enslavement and colonization
of the African peoples, and which may still be engaged in
racism and neo-colonialism, to desist from any further damage
and start building bridges of conciliation, cooperation, and
through reparation.
Exhorts all African states to grant entrance as of
right to all persons of African descent and right to obtain
residence in those African states, if there is no disqualifying
element on the African claiming the "right to return" to his
ancestral home, Africa.
Urges those countries which were enriched by slavery and
the slave trade to give total relief from Foreign Debt, and
allow the debtor countries of the diaspora to become free for
self-development and from immediate and direct economic domination.
Calls upon the countries largely characterised as profiteers
from the slave trade to support proper and reasonable representation
of African Peoples in the political and economic areas of the
highest decision-making bodies.
Requests the OAU to intensify its efforts in restructing the
international system in pursuit of justice with special reference
to a permanent African seat on the Security Council of the U.N.
