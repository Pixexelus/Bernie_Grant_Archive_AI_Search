reparations settlement. A
7. THE CLAIM IF NOT SETTLED BY
combination of the following could be AGREEMENT WOULD ULTIMATELY
included:
- an apology made by the Queen
and other heads of state to
Africans world wide;
the cancellation of debt, on the
basis that Europe owes far more
to Africa and the Caribbean than
Africa and the Caribbean owes
to Europe.
- crash programmes of
development in the inner cities
where African descendants
suffer the consequences of
institutionalized racism.
- programmes to build the
infrastructure of the African
continent, once a land of well-
developed trading networks.
- repatriation for diaspora Africans
who wish to return to the
continent from which their
ancestors were taken.
Fortunately there are many seekers
after truth who are trying to find
answers to all these questions
through careful research. Any figures
put on the various elements of the
reparations claim will at best be
estimates made from a basis of
sound historical research. However
the research process itself will have
a value far beyond of the calculation
of figures. It will be an educative
process through which the horrors of
the past will be re-examined. The
more the details of the slave system
and its consequences are exposed,
the more understanding there will be,
among African people and white, of
the justice of the reparations claim.

BE DETERMINED BY A SPECIAL
INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL
RECOGNIZED BY ALL PARTIES
T
here is at present no court
which would be competent to
hear a claim for Reparations
for Africa and Africans in the
Diaspora. The International Court of
Justice is competent to hear claims
by one state against another for
breaches of international law. But
this claim is on a much vaster scale
than a claim between states. It would
need a new mechanism,
commensurate with the unique and
massive issues of which I have
spoken.
The absence of a court is no
impediment to the Reparations claim.
In the examples given earlier, the
legitimacy of the claim was
recognized and embodied in an
agreement, without there having
been any pre-existing tribunal to deal
with the grievance. As part of the
agreement a mechanism for dealing
with individual claims was
established. The nature of the court
which makes the binding decisions
will depend on the issues at stake
and the negotiations which have
preceded the agreement.

For example, the agreement made
between Iran and the United States
for the payments of reparations set
up a nine-member Commission,
consisting of three American judges,
three Iranian, and three from
countries not involved in the dispute.
It sat in three chambers of three
judges, and made adjudications on
nearly four thousand claims.
At this stage, therefore, it is
premature to consider the
composition of any Commission or
Tribunal which might ultimately
adjudicate upon the African
Reparations Claim. The adjudicating
body will only carry authority if it has
been set up with the concurrence of
all parties to the dispute. The
international recognition of the justice
of the claim is a condition precedent
to the setting up of any judicial
machinery.
This, then is the great task in which
lawyers have a specific but mo
significant contribution to make. They
are only a small part of the panoply
of forces which will be needed -
historians, archaeologists, artists,
writers, politicians, sociologists,
psychologists, and beyond them all,
people of good will, of all races, who
perceive that the crime of slavery
was a monstrous evil, for which
atonement and reparation is long
overdue.
