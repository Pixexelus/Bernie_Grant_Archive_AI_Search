De-Briefing on preparatory Conference on African Reparations
that we can
The Birmingham Preparatory Conference confirms
organise as a people once we seize the opportunity and work
deligently. The Conference reflected the fact that the desire for
change, and the willingness to effect it burns deep in all our
hearts.
At least one hundred people attended the conference, but it was
disappointing to note that there was no one from Cardiff, Bristol
or Liverpool. To that extent the conference did not quite achieve
it's purpose.
It was also a rather low key affair,
held as it was in the
held as
Council
Chamber
at Birmingham.
It did
not
generate
the
enthusiasm and energy that previous meetings had and this was in
part due to the setting.
It is clear that much action is need to create and generate
momentum if reparations are to be won, and to this extent it is
clear that the role of the Steering Committee must be more action
orientated with less emphasis on talking.
We need to be more professional and dynamic, more pro-active than
we have previously been, we must set the agenda and not merely
follow someone else's. It must be acknowledged that the sub-
committees have not all functioned and that to rely upon this
mechanism is to inhibit the ability of the organisation to
develop. As a matter of urgency we need a constitution so that
we have a formal basis to conduct our business.
