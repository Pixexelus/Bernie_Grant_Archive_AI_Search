Contemplating the condition of the Black World is vexatious to
the spirit: that is probably the strongest impetus which has
brought us all here today.
For many centuries, and especially in the last five, the black
skin has been a badge of contempt. For instance, it used to be
said in Brazil that if you are white and running down the street,
you are an athlete; but if you are black and running down the
street, you are a thief! And in most parts of the world today, if
you are white and rich, you are honoured and celebrated, and all
Sdoors fly open as you approach; but if you are black and rich, youfor
are under suspicion, and handcuffs and guard dogs stand ready to
take you away.

Yes, the black skin is still the badge of contempt in the
world today, as it has been for nearly 2,000 years. To make sure
it does not remain so in the 21st century is perhaps the overall
purpose of our search for reparations.
We are gathered here today, thinkers and activists who want to
change Black People's condition in the world. What things do we
need to change, both in the world and in ourselves, if we are to
accomplish the mission of reparations? What changes must we make
in structures, in psychology, in historical consciousness and much
beidelse?

We might begin by noting that Blacks are not the only people
in the world who are seeking, or who have sought, reparations. In
fact, by only now pressing our claim for reparations, we
molatecomers to a varied company of peoples in the Americans, in
Asia, and in Europe. Here is a partial catalogue of reparations,
115 paid and pending, which are 20th century precedents for reparations
