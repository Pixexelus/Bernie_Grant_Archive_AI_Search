SCOTS THE DIFFERENCE?
DESTINY
AS THE STONE OF SCONE WAS RETURNED TO SCOTLAND
THIS WEEK, BERNIE GRANT HAS RENEWED CALLS FOR
AFRICAN ARTEFACTS TO BE RETURNED TO AFRICA.
"I AM DELIGHTED THAT THE SCOTS HAVE HAD THEIR
STONE RETURNED, BUT WHAT GOES FOR ONE MUST GO
FOR ALL. WE HAVE A HISTORY TOO, AND MUCH OF OUR
CULTURE IS LOCKED AWAY IN BRITISH MUSEUMS."
"LIKE THE STONE OF SCONE, VAST QUANTITIES OF
PRICELESS AFRICAN TREASURES HAVE BEEN IN BRITISH
HANDS FOR FAR TOO LONG. MOST OF THEM WERE
LOOTED DURING EUROPEAN COLONISATION OF AFRICA,
AND THEY ARE A TESTIMONY TO THE SOPHISTICATION
OF THE ADVANCED CIVILISATIONS OF AFRICA, BEFORE
EUROPE TORE IT APART. THEY TELL OUR STORY, AND
OUR HISTORY AS BLACK PEOPLE IS DENIED FOR AS LONG
AS THEY REMAIN HIDDEN AWAY."
"PREVIOUS REQUESTS FOR THE RESTITUTION OF THESE
ARTIFACTS HAVE BEEN REFUSED BY BRITISH
GOVERNMENTS. YET, AS MORE AND MORE COUNTRIES
ARE RETURNING STOLEN ART, BRITAIN MUST BE PRESSED
TO CHANGE POSITION ON THIS ISSUE, AND AS BLACK
PEOPLE WE MUST MAKE OUR VOICES HEARD."
