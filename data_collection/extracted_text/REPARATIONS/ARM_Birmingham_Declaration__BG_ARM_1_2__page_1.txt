BIRMINGHAM DECLARATION
We, being people of African origin resident in Britain, having met
at the Birmingham Conference o
Conference on Reparations on the 11th December
1993, under the auspices of the Africa Reparations Movement (UK),
taking account of the Abuja Proclamation of the Group of Eminent
Persons, and the call by the Organisation of African Unity (OAU),
Unity(OAU),
to Africans in Africa and the diaspora, to set up National
Committees for Reparations.
Recalling the severe and crippling damage done to Africa and its
diaspora by European enslavement, colonialism, and neo-colonialism.
Convinced that people of African origin have a just case, morally
and in law, for compensation and redress for the most heinous
Laveb
crimes ever committed against humanity; the legacy of which
continues to afflict and debilitate Africa and its diaspora to
this day; particularly the destruction of African culture and
civilisation, the interruption and usurpation of African advances
in mathematics, science, medicine and theology, and the killing of
African people in genocidal proportions.
