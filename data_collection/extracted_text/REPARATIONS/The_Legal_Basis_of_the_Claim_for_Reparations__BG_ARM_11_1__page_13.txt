The programme for rehabilitation,

16. Some people have argued
that slavery and colonialism have
contributed to the development of
Africans. Is this true?
подае
This is palpably not true. Those who
say that Africans who have
advanced have done so because
slavery put them in a 'conducive
atmosphere' to advance should visit
the slave relics like the Isle of Goree,
Elmina Castle, Badagry and other
monuments to the infamous trade to
understand how wrong they are.
Those that advanced as in the
Caribbean, United States and
elsewhere, did so by the Will of God,
and in spite of the slave conditions -
certainly not because of them. The
struggle of the black slaves is an
epic worthy to be remembered. It is
the story of a people who fought
back under the most difficult
conditions trying to climb the ladder
of progress. Reparations is an
attempt to give their descendants
some assistance in climbing that
ladder so as to reduce the odds
against them. Struggle is a part of
our culture and the ascent from
slavery to our present position is a
source of pride. The struggle
continues.
17. Why do you relate colonialism
to slavery?
It is most important for us to grasp
the linkage. The Atlantic slave trade
used European capital to take
African salves to the New World.
With abolition, European capital
turned its attention to the exploitation
of African labour, land and mineral
resources in Africa itself. The Atlantic
slave trade had identified slavery
solely with the black person,
perpetually in a degraded and
dehumanized position. Colonialism in
Africa was based on the racial
foundations laid by the Atlantic slave
trade. Because the world failed to
recognize the inhuman slave trade
as a crime against humanity,
European powers went in to commit
equally heinous crimes against
Africans under colonialism.
(Remember Leopold's Congo, and
the German war against the
Hereros). Even after nominal
independence had been granted,
with African human and material
resources already depleted by the
slave trade and colonialism, the
Western world continues to control
African economies and to manipulate
its governments for their own ends.
They bear a lot of responsibility for
the increasing degradation, collapse
of states, hunger, disease and
gloomy prospects.
18. Since the Africans at home
were not enslaved, why should
they ask for Reparations?
They are asking for reparations for
two reasons.
slave trade has been racial
prejudice. Arabs enslaved not only
blacks, but also whites and
sometimes other Arabs. They
sometimes inter-married with black
slaves and thus there was no
outright prejudice against all black
people during the earlier period of
the slave trade. In the case of the
Atlantic trade, however, all the slave
masters were white and the slaves
black; and this has given rise to the
heinous practice of looking down on
black people. All Africans suffered
from this, whether they were
enslaved or not. This was the
foundation of colonialism and neo-
colonialism in Africa. Prejudice
against black people spread almost
every where in the world and we
have to redress this problem. The
cost of this world-wide prejudicere
against black peoples in incalculable.
It is revealed in such incidents as the
Los Angeles riots, and it is beginning
to show itself in some parts of
Germany, Britain and France. It is
even said to exist in Mauritania and
other parts of Africa; thus the
vinu
psychological damage is one of the
things we have to redress.
19. What can I do to help this
crusade?
We should hope, having read this
that you will feel it is your duty to ved
stand up for the rights of all black
people. To respect your own leaders,
to spread the story of the crusade
and the facts in this paper, but above
all, to support your country as a great
black country of which you are
proud. You should never measure
(a) The effects of the slave trade
was not felt by the immediate victims
only but by all black peoples. The
impact on Africa in the loss of
people, destruction of agriculture and yourselves against any other
trade, insecurity of life, social
degradation etc. was disastrous and
no black people, even those who
participated in the trade could
escape its destructive
consequences.
