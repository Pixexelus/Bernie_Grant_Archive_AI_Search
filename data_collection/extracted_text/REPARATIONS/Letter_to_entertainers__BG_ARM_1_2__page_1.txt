RE REPARATIONS FOR AFRICANS IN AFRICA AND THE DIASPORA
you
We live in a time of immense trauma and crippling confusion,
a time in which simply defining a way forward, in and of
a time of despair
itself becomes an obstacle to progress,
and doubt.
One important consequences of this is that our community
here in the UK has yet to articulate a programme of action
designd with the specific purpose of elevating ourselves
onto a higher plane of struggle, and devise a strategy
commensurate with the awesome challenges that confront us
of the future.
and those as yet unseen troubles
today,
However all is not dispair, indeed it is the highest tribute
to the fortitude and resilience of the African personality
that a world-wide movement (or chestrated by the Organisation
of African Unity (OAU)) pressing for reparations to Africa
and its diaspora has been born; and the Afican Reparations
Movement of the United Kingdom (ARM (UK)) setup in response
The central theme of the reparations movement is the demand
for compensation (in cash and in kind i.e) as recompence
for the devastation and sheer brutality inflicted upon
peoples of African origin as a direct result of the most
henious crime ever committed by man against man; the
enslavement of peoples of African origin by peoples of
European origin.
This demand for compensation also extends to redress for
Europe's plunder of Africa under colonialism and
neo- olonialism.
Reparations is also about confronting and dismantling the
superlies and heart rendering myths about our history and
charcter circulating the world, confirming our identity and
devising a way of thinking that will liberate us from our
near traumatized state and ensure that the youth of today
can become. the strong tall and proud men of tomorrow.
