Bernie Grant says his views have been distorted. The

L
Reparation, not
repatriation
ast week, the Voice newspaper broke
an agreement with me to do a serious
interview on the future for black
people in Britain. Instead they chose
to trivialise and sensationalise remarks I
made at a small meeting in Brighton, taking
those remarks completely out of context.
What I was talking about at that meeting
was the future for black people in this country.
I said that this must now be the subject of a
serious debate within our community. I make
no apologies for that.
I believe that we must stop reacting to
events and go on the offensive. For too long,
the black community has preferred to sweep
things under the carpet, and been afraid to talk
about what is happening to us, let alone about
the options for the future. We are now mature
enough to have that debate, and there is no
time to lose.
For the vast majority of black people in this
country, little has changed since we or our
parents came here in the fifties and sixties. We
are at the bottom of every single pile-for
example in housing and jobs-and the culture
and traditions that enabled us to survive in the
past are being destroyed. We have suffered
more than anyone else from the recession
hitting this country. In particular, we are con-
cerned about the future for our children, who
are getting an education of which we do not
approve, and who have nothing to look for-
ward to but the dole.
If
you add to this the growth of racism and
fascism, and the rise in racist attacks and
murders, many of us are beginning to feel
distinctly nervous about our future. The way
in which our black brothers and sisters are
being treated in Europe makes us shudder.
And when we hear that British ministers are
sitting down with their European counter-
parts to discuss "common approaches" to
dealing with "migrants" and the like, we have
real cause for alarm. The established political
parties in Europe have merely accommodated
racism, and all the signs are that they will do
so here.
So do we just go on reacting? I think not.
Personally, I am fed up with going on one
demonstration after another whenever a black
person is murdered. It's time to start talking
strategically.
I dissociate myself completely from the
views of fascists and the right wing. I have
not spent my life fighting against racism in
this country to play their game. Their line is
that black people in this country have no right
to be here, and that they should go back to
"where they came from".
15 OCTOBER 1993
My own vision of the future for us as black
people is connected with the campaign for
reparations for Africa. I have been involved
in this for some time, and there is now serious
work going on in relation to this in Britain and
around the world. I believe that it offers us
both a way of understanding our situations as
black people here in Britain, as well as a
glimpse of an alternative future.

against black people grew up as a

way of justifying the exploitation of
This is claptrap, of course. We have every
right to be here, we are British citizens, and a
lot of us were born here.
However, the fact of the matter is that there
are many black people who are now voting
with their feet, and going to live in black
countries where they have connections. They
have had enough of the
hardship, and the daily
insults, and want to find
something better for
themselves and their
children. They don't
want to spend the whole
of their lives fighting
racism. Many have al-
ready sent their children
to black countries to be
educated properly and
to give them the self-
confidence that comes
from living among
other black people.
There are a lot more
people who come to me
asking for help to go
home. I see no reason
why they shouldn't get
it if they want it- after
all, they have worked
damned hard in the
worst jobs in this
country and are owed
something.
Now, I am not saying
that this is any solution
people could be stereotyped as sub-human
and worthless, then there was no reason why
their land and raw materials could not be
stolen from them through colonisation, why
they could not be murdered in large numbers,
and why they could not become the slaves of
the white man.
The colonisation and exploitation of Africa
and the enslavement of African people must
be the biggest crime in the whole of history,

What I am in favour of, however, is of black
people talking among themselves frankly
about how we go forward in an increasingly
hostile environment, and considering all the
options. The only problem with this is that we
cannot do so in this society without our being
overheard by the white media, and by right-
wingers like Winston Churchill who distort
our views for their own ends.

still suffer, both materi-
ally and psychologi-
cally. Yet we never had
even an apology, let
alone any form of
compensation.
The reparations
movement demands
that the debts of black
countries be cancelled
and that substantial
sums be repaid to them
to invest in their future.
This is, of course, a
long-term goal, but
something that offers
some hope to black
people in a global sense.
In this context, there are
many black people
who, if they were given
the positive prospect of
participating in the re-
development and re-
emergence of black
countries, would wish
to do so, especially if
they were supported in
a structured programme
funded in the spirit of
reparations by those
who have exploited
black people for so
long. This is a far cry
from any idea of run-
ning away from our
current situation, or of
repatriation.
These are not new
ideas, and the mention
of them should not have created the fuss it
has. I shall certainly continue to talk about
them. I am not prepared to let the racists and
the fascists set the agenda, and do not accept
that it is politically incorrect to talk about
anything that holds some alternative for black
people in the future. We have to begin the
debate now, before things get any worse.
