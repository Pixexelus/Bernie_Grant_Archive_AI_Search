This First Pan-African Conference on Reparations held in
Abuja, Nigeria, April 27 - 29, 1993, sponsored by the Group
of Eminent Persons (GEP) and the Commission for Reparations
of the Organization of African Unity, and the Federal Government
of the Republic of Nigeria.
Recalling the Organization of African Unity's establishment
of a machinery the Group of Eminent Persons for appraising
the issue of reparations in relation to the damage done to
Africa and its Diaspora by enslavement, colonization, and
neo-colonialism.
Convinced that the issue of reparations is an important
question requiring the united action of Africa and its Diaspora
and worthy of the active support of the rest of the international
community.
Fully persuaded that the damage sustained by the African
peoples is not a "thing of the past" but is painfully manifest
in the damaged lives of contemporary Africans from Harlem
to Harare, in the damaged economies of the Black World from
Guinea to Guyana, from Somalia to Surinam.
Respectfully aware of historic precedents in reparations,
ranging from German payment of restitution to the Jews for
the enormous tragedy of the Nazi Holocaust to the question
of compensating Japanese-Americans for injustice of internment
by Roosevelt Administration in the United States during the
World War II.
Cognizant of the fact that compensation for injustice
need not necessarily be paid only in capital transfer but could
include service to the victims or other forms of restitution
and readjustiment of the relationship agreeable to both parties.
