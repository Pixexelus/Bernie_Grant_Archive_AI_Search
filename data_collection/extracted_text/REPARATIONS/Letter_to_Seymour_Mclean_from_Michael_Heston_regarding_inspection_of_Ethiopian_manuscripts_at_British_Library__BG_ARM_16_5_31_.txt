Rear Mr. Men
I refer to your letter of 2 March 1995 to Viscount Astor, Under Secretary of State at the
Department of National Heritage, and that of 10 January to the Prime Minister. I have been
asked to reply to both letters.
Further to my own letter to you of 18 January 1995, and to our various telephone
conversations, I am pleased to say that officials from the Ethiopian Embassy, along with an
official from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and myself, have inspected several
Ethiopian manuscripts at the British Library. Curatorial staff from the library were most
helpful in showing the group the storage, environmental conditions and means of public
access to these manuscripts, as well as explaining the relevant conservation and cataloguing
procedures. The group also learned of the very good relations the British Library has with
the Ethiopian Institute in Addis Ababa.
The matter now rests with officials from the Ethiopian Embassy and it is for them to take the
matter forward - or not - as they see fit. Until we hear from them we will not involve
ourselves further in the matter.
Yours sincerely
Michael Hil
