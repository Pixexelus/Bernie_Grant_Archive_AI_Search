to survivors of the concentration
camps, again to make reparation for
the physical and mental agony of
the concentration camps. If a victim
died before the claims were agreed,
his claim died with him, since the
pain and suffering were personal to
him.
But there are many cases where
the consequences of the crime
committed are visited upon
descendants. Where property has
been expropriated, the loss is
suffered not merely by the then
owner, but also by his descendants
who have lost an inheritance which
would otherwise have been theirs. In
such cases, international law gives a
remedy, even if the claimant was not
born at the time of the expropriation.
For example, the Order made under
the British Foreign Compensation Act
of 1950 provided that the Foreign
Compensation Commission should
treat as established any claim
relating to certain property in Egypt
which had been sequestrated by the
Nasser government if the applicant
was the owner or is the successor in
title of such owner, making it plain
that the children and the
grandchildren of the original
dispossessed owners were entitled
to claim.
More recently, since the unification of
Germany, claims have been pressed
successfully by the sons and
daughters of property owners whose
lands were seized after the German
Democratic Republic was set up. No
one doubts their rights to claim, even
though they may have been children,
or even unborn, when their family's
lands were taken over.
Claims have been made not only by
descendants, but by the nation-state
which has had to bear the burden of
paying for the consequences of the
crime. As noted above, Israel
successfully claimed reparations
from West Germany for the costs of
resettling Jewish refugees - even
though the state of Israel did not
exist at the time when the Nazi
regime committed its crimes against
the Jews. It is also significant that
West Germany, which felt obliged to
meet the claim. was also a different
state, territorially as well as
politically, from the German Reich
which was responsible for the
atrocities.
In principle, therefore, the passage of
time since slavery ended is no barrier
to the claims of African peoples,
provided that it can be proved that
the consequence of the crime of
slavery continue to manifest
themselves to the prejudice of
Africans now living in Africa and the
Diaspora. On the point, the evidence
of historical experts is clear and
unequivocal.
On the African continent, flourishing
civilizations were destroyed; ordered
systems of government were broken
up; millions of citizens were forcibly
removed; and a pattern of poverty
and underdevelopment directly
resulted, which now affects nearly
every resident of Africa. In the
Americas, the slavery system gave
rise to poverty, landlessness,
underdevelopment, as well as to the
crushing of culture and languages,
the loss of identity, the inculcation of
inferiority among Black people, and
the indoctrination of whites into a
racist mind set - all of which continue
to this day to affect the prospects
and quality of Black people's lives in
the Caribbean, USA, Canada and
Europe.
While there is no limitation period in
international law, unreasonable delay
could be a reason for refusing a
claim. A state which had a just claim,
but which failed to advance it over a
long period, could be held to have
acquiesced in the wrong or to waived
its right to claim reparations.
However, no objection along these
lines could properly be made against
the claim of Africa and Africans in the
Diaspora. In the case of Africa and
the Caribbean region, the period of
slavery and the slave trade was
followed by the period of colonialism.
It can be urged that colonialism itself
was a crime in international law, for it
was a usurpation, imposed by force,
of the rights of the colonized
peoples to their sovereignty. It was at
the very least a crime against peace,
and in most if not all colonized
territories, crimes against humanity
were frequently committed. In the
case of the United States, former
slaves were subjected to a system of
exclusion, separate development,
racial persecution, civil rights denials
and ghettoization, which has only in
part been overcome in the recent
years following the civil rights
he civil rights
movement.
The important point is that African
peoples, until recently, had no
independent voice, nor even any
status in the world community. How
could the people of, say Ghana or
Jamaica make a claim for
reparations when their country was
considered to be an 'overseas
possession' of the very country
whose people had kidnapped and
enslaved their ancestors?. Still less
were African-Americans, as they
struggled for the right to be
recognized as citizens, in any
position to make any claims - even if
there was any international forum in
which a claim could be brought,
which there was not.
