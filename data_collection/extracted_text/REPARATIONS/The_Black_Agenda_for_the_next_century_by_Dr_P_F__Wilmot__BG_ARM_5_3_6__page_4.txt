M THE SLAVE MASTERS HAD A DELIBERATE POLICY OF WORKING
9AD SLAVES TO DEATH SO THAT THEY COULD RECUPERATE THEIR COSTS IN THE
SHORTEST POSSIBLE TIME. IT WAS CHEAPER TO REPLACE DEAD SLAVES
WITH IMPORTS RATHER THAN TREAT THEM WELL AND HAVE THEM LIVE TO
OLD AGE.
THE RESULT WAS THAT, DESPITE PROLIFIC BREEDING, THE
SLAVE POPULATION

FAILED TO KEEP UP WITH IMPORTS. RICHARD HART
ESTIMATED THAT OVER THE PERIOD OF ALMOST 150 YEARS BEFORE
HOT ABOLITION, ONE MILLION SLAVES WERE IMPORTED INTO JAMAICA, TWO
MAMUN HUNDRED THOUSAND WERE RE-EXPORTED, LEAVING A NET OF 800, 000.
THE TOTAL POPULATION WAS JUST 323, 827 IN 1833. ERIC

ACCOUNTS OF THE TREATMENT OF SLAVES DURING CAPTURE,
CETAT TRANSPORT AND WORK MAKE IT SEEM SURPRISING THAT SO MANY HAVE
SURVIVED TILL TODAY. CLR JAMES PROVIDES GRAPHIC DESCRIPTIONS:
"THE SLAVES WERE COLLECTED IN THE INTERIOR, FASTENED ONE TO THE
OTHER IN COLUMNS, LOADED WITH HEAVY STONES OF 40 OR 50 POUNDS IN
WOW WEIGHT TO PREVENT ATTEMPTS AT ESCAPE, AND THEN MARCHED THE LONG
PEVAJOURNEY TO THE SEA, SOMETIMES HUNDREDS OF MILES, THE WEAKLY AND
SICK DROPPING TO DIE. . . . AT THE SLAVE PORTS THEY WERE PENNED INTO
'TRUNKS' FOR THE INSPECTION OF THE BUYERS. . . ."
