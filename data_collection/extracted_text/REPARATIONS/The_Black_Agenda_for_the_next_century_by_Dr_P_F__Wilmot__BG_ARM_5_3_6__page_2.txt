THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE OF 17 NOVEMBER, 1993,
REPORTED THAT THE US CONGRESS FORMALLY APOLOGISED TO NATIVE
HAWAIIANS FOR OVERTHROWING THEIR NINARCHY 100 YEARS AGO. WHEN
WILL THE CONGRESS APOLOGISE FOR ENSLAVING AFRICA? WHEN WILL
EUROPE APOLOGISE FOR OVERTHROWING HUNDREDS OF AFRICAN KINGDOMS,
AND ENSLAVING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF AFRICANS? IF ALL THE OTHER
INJURED AND DISINHERITED OF THE WORLD DESERVE REDRESS, WHY NOT
AFRICA? WHY COMPENSATE THE SLAVE MASTERS INSTEAD OF THEIR
VICTIMS, WHEN SLAVERY IS "ABOLISHED"?
AFRICANS AT HOME AND IN THE DIASPORA HAVE NEVER BEEN
Main COMPENSATED FOR THE CRIMES OF SLAVERY AND COLONISATION OF THE
12 PAST
PAST FIVE CENTURIES, EVEN THOUGH THESE SURPASS THE SUFFERING OF
MAHON
ALL OTHER INJURED PEOPLES, AND PERSIST UNTIL TODAY. THE ECONOMIC

DISLOCATION SUFFERED BY THE CONTINENT IS OBVIOUS FROM THE
SQUATTER CAMPS OF SOUTH AFRICA, THE DESTITUTE MASSES OF ANGOLA,
TO THE CRACK-INFESTED GHETTOES OF THE AMERICAN CAPITAL. THE
RACISM OF EUROPE AND AMERICA, WHICH DID NOT EXIST BEFORE
AFRICANS WERE ENSLAVED, BUT WAS INVENTED TO JUSTIFY THE
INHUMANITIES OF ENSLAVMENT, HAS NOT JUST PERSISTED BUT

WAR COMMANDERS AND TREASURERS TO BE FROM SLAVE
LINEAGES. AS THEY WERE CONSIDERED MORE TRUSTWORTHY THAN THOSE OF
ROYAL BLOOD.
IN FACT THE MOTHERS OF MANY RULERS WERE OF SLAVE
ORIGIN, BECAUSE THE RULING CLASSES CONSIDERED THIS USEFUL IN
CEMENTING TIES WITH THE SLAVE POPULATION. NO FATHER DENIED HIS
OWN CHILDREN BECAUSE THEIR MOTHERS WERE "SLAVES". IN MANY
CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN SOCIETIES, SOME VERY POWERFUL OFFICIALS ARE
KNOWN TO BE FROM "SLAVE" LINEAGES, WITHOUT ANY DIMINITION OF
PRESTIGE.
