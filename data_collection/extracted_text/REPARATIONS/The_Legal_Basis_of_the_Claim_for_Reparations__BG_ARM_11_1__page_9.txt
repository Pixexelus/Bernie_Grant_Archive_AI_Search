create more problems than it solved.
Enormous research would be
needed to identify the companies
and families, to determine how much
money was made by their ancestors,
and to calculate how much should be
forfeited by the present shareholders
or family members. The process
wold inevitably be somewhat
arbitrary, and potentially oppressive,
and it would be rejected both by the
targets themselves and their
governments.
I would however make one
exception: When it can be proved
that a work of art or an artifact, now
in a public or private collection, was
originally obtained illegally in the
course of an invasion or plundering
exercise in Africa. In this one case,
the international law concept of
restitution in kind could be applied.
The reparation process must include
the restoration of identifiable
treasures to the country which most
closely represents the people from
whom they were robbed.
In reality in these cases of
restitution, the individual owner
would lose the work of art, but would
most probably receive compensation
for its value from his own
government. This is because the
restitution would have been made
with the co-operation of the relevant
European or other government; and
it is a normal principle that
compensation must be paid when
private property is taken away by the
act of a government.
The reason why the 'Defendants' to
the reparations claim should be
governments, is that it is
governments which have some
measure of control over their
national wealth, through their
reserves and their taxation powers; it
is governments who must in the end
be persuaded that reparations are to
be paid as a matter of justice; it is
governments who can determine
whether Africa's debt burden should
be unladen from its shoulders; and it
is governments which are
responsible for making international
treaties and implementing them
through the passage of laws.
Historians will advise as to which
countries have profited most from
slavery and the slave trade. The
major European maritime trading
nations and colonizers can be easily
identified. So can the United States,
as a country which grew rich on
slave labour and the exploitation of
African Americans. However, as the
next section indicates, the NT
assessment and evaluation of
responsibility will be a vast
undertaking.
6. THE AMOUNT OF THE CLAIM
WOULD BE ASSESSED BY
EXPERTS IN EACH ASPECT OF
LIFE, AND IN EACH REGION,
AFFECTED BY THE INSTITUTION
OF SLAVERY
T
he assessment of what
should be claimed is perhaps
the most pressing and
onerous task to be faced by the
reparations movement. Each wied
affected country will have be studied,
and perhaps even each people with
each country. Different
considerations will apply to the
peoples of the African continent; the
peoples of the now independent
countries where slavery flourished,
and the people who are minorities in
Europe or North America.
The damage may be classified and
researched under different headings.
There is economic damage, cultural
damage, social damage,
psychological damage. To put
monetary figures on any of the
elements of the claim raises
questions to which there are no easy
answers: how do you assess the
value of the loss to Africa millions of
young people kidnapped and
transported over 200 years ago?
What figure can be placed on the
psychological damage inflicted by a
system which is still deeply racist?
Can it be proved that the slave
system destroyed old and flourishing
African civilizations, and if so, how is
their value to be measured? What
level of restitution is appropriate for
the African peoples of the Diaspora?
Another approach, perhaps to be
adopted in parallel, is to measure the
amount by which various European
nations were directly enriched by the
institution of slavery. In the Report of
the Inquiry into Racism in Liverpool,
which I conducted in 1989, I quoted
the historian Ramsay Muir, who
wrote in 1907. He described the
slave trade as "the pride of
Liverpool", for it flooded the town
with wealth.
which invigorated every industry,
provided the capital for docks,
enriched and employed the mills of
Lancashire, and afforded the
means of opening out new and
ever new lines of trade. Beyond a
doubt it was the slave trade which
raised Liverpool from a struggling
port to be one of the richest and
most prosperous trading centres in
the world.
Similar evidence could be uncovered
about Bristol, London, Bordeaux,
and many others ports.
Other questions arise as to the
manifold components of a
