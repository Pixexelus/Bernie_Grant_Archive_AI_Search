INTRODUCTION
On September 27, 1990, Bashorun M. K. O. Abiola addressed an African-American
workshop under the auspices of the Black Caucus of the United States Congress. He did so
in his capacity as Patron of the Caucus. The theme of his address was "Reparations to
Africans in the Motherland and in the Diaspora". It was not the first time that the subject was
broached. It had been mentioned and even dwelt upon in the course of many Pan-Africanist
crusades. But Bashorun Abiola's presentation on that occasion was different.
At the end of his address, there were such unprecedented emotional scenes as to make
the spontaneous ovation that greeted it the longest in the history of any gathering of the
United States Congressional Black Caucus. There and then instant volunteers emerged
pledging to assist in the global distribution of copies of the speech to as far and wide as was
possible. In Nigeria, the speech was so well received that many newspapers gave generous
space to it.
The time of these publications coincided with the period of activities marking the 10th
Anniversary of the founding of the Concord Press of Nigeria Limited, publishers of the
Concord Group of Newspapers and Magazines. To round up activities marking the
anniversary, a world Conference with the same theme, that is "Reparations to Africa and
Africans in the Diaspora" was arranged. It was held at the Nigerian Institute of International
Affairs in Lagos on 13th and 14th December 1990, but not without its problems. Apart from
the time constraint which limited consultation, the occupation of Kuwait by Iraqi forces
adversely affected the conference. The occupation robbed the gathering of the contribution
of eminent law makers from Britain and the United States who had accepted invitations to
participate but who had to serve, at that point in time, on important legislative committees
on the Kuwaiti-Iraqi crisis.
Nevertheless, the overall turnout was very good. The conference drew resource
persons from the national and international academia, black groups from the British House
of Commons and the United States Congress, the High Commissions of the West Indies in
Nigeria, some black activist groups as well as labour. The opening was impressive, the
sessions well attended, and deliberations at all levels serious and well articulated. The
keynote address by President Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida which was delivered on his behalf
by Vice-president Augustus Aikhomu has since become an important reference on the issue
of reparations to Africans. The serious deliberations led to the important communique which
has formed the basis for the continuation of further work on the matter.
