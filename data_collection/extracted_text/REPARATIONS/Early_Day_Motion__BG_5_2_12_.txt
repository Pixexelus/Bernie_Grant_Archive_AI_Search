HOUSE OF COMMONS
LONDON SW1A OAA
EDM 1987 of Session 1992/93, tabled on 10 May 1993
ABUJA PROCLAMATION
Mr Bernie Grant
That this House welcomes the Abuja Proclamation issued after the First
Pan-African Conference on Reparations, sponsored by the Organisation of
African Unity, and the Government of Nigeria; notes the historical
precedents in reparations such as the case of German repayment for
restitution to the Jews for the enormous tragedy of the Holocaust; calls
upon the international community to recognise that the unprecedented moral
debt owed to African people has yet to be paid, and urges all those
countries who were enriched by enslavement and colonisation to review the
case for reparations to be paid to Africa and to Africans in the Diaspora;
acknowledges the continuing painful economic and personal consequences of
the exploitation of Africa and Africans in the Diaspora and the racism it
has generated; and supports the OAU as it intensifies its efforts to
pursue the cause of reparations.
