This Group was empaneled by the
OAU to work out the strategies for
pursuing the Movement. They have
created a net-work of experts to
reach into almost every country of
the world for the establishment of
units which will spread out and
inform all people of this cause. They
are to find facts on the effects of
slavery and colonialism, political,
social and otherwise, and in general
assist in obtaining justice for all o
Africans and peoples of African ow
descent.

21. What is the role of the United
Nations in this programme?
The Programme has moved from the
early expressions including that of
the Forum of 1990 in which M.K.O.
Abiola and the learned academics
and statesmen whom he invited,
expressed in precise terms the call
for Reparations to Africans in the
Motherland and in the Diaspora. This
call was supported by President
Ibrahim Babangida of the Federalee
Republic of Nigeria, thus giving it a
national platform. As Chairman of
the OAU, President Babangida put it
on the OAU Agenda and the Heads
of State supported it unanimously.
The OAU at its Summit in Dakar
empaneled the GEP, thus carrying
the Movement from the national to
the whole of Africa.
The next stage which will take some
work is to take the message to the
world and work out strategies by
which the Movement will obtain the
support of the United Nations. The
United Nations will then place this
question before the world.

this Movement so far?

other leaders in Africa and abroad

subject. And more and more ordinary
people, spanning every field of she
