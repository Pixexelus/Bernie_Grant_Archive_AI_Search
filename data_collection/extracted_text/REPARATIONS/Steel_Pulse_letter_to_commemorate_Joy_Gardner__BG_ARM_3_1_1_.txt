Dear Mrs Simpson,
Steel Pulse are currently working on a new album and wish to commemorate the memory of Joy on
the album sleeve.
Steel Pulse albums sell worldwide and therefore this will be another thorn in the side of this state
inspired injustice, and will assist in not allowing the memory of Joy to go quiet.
If this is acceptable to you, we will need both a colour and b/w photo of Joy. We have spoken to
Sharon Wallis at the Voice Newspaper who has colour photo's, and who put us in touch with Bernie
Grants office.
We await to hear your instructions on this, however, please know that our hearts are with you always.
Yours sincerely,
ะดั
ANDY BOWEN
