In reality there are many ways that African peoples in the
Diaspora express and organise ourselves, some of these ways react
to and reflect the racism we face, some are more successful than
others. If we are to move forward as a people we are charged with
the responsibility of finding ways of negotiating those real
differences, without putting each other down or name calling. How
for example will we handle situations in which African brothers
and sisters decline to call themselves African but prefer instead
the term, black British ? If we accuse them of having a slave
mentality will we be likely to get them to take pride in their
heritage and identities ? No, we must put energy into persuading
them of our point of view rather than condemning them. If we do
benot do this we will be a movement of like-minded people but not
a movement which includes all African people.
It is important that we clarify our relation ship with people of
Asian origin because this issue will be exploited by those who
have long practised divide and rule. In organising as Africans
many of us will continue to work closely with Asian peoples
around our shared experience of racism in Britain. But we have
ea right and a duty to work on our own specific experience to the
extent that it is distinct form that of Asian people. The theft
of our peoples and our languages marks the African experience as
different from that which occurred for others. It would be a
fruitless and meaningless competition to try to measure who's
experience was the worst. It is sufficient for us to say that we
demand justice for what has happened to us and in doing so we do
not deny the justice that others many also demand.

ea significant section of white British society of the justice of

many of us because of past experience will not work closely white

the support of elements in the Labour Party, the Churches and
others with influence. This does not mean that there should be

One of the many manifestations of the impact and legacy of racism
on African peoples are the ways that we have become so deeply
suspicious and critical of each other. It is easy to bad-mouth
another brother or sister by calling them an Uncle Tom or a
coconut, but in some ways the even more damaging aspect of our
suspicion is to assume that others are not to be trusted with the
same integrity that we ourselves possess. I am thinking here of
the suspicion that

I have myself been wondering who benefits from this belief, since

it is evident that in cutting of black professionals and
bacademics from the grass roots of our communities they are less
able to serve the whole of our community. But I also know that
whatever the suspicions that exist about those working in the
"mainstream" there is a pride and a satisfaction from much of the
I work they do. For example the black social workers in the early
80's who critiqued the impact of transracial fostering and
as adoption of black children put facts where our anecdotes existed.

The black teachers and academics who went into the institutions
that under-valued and sought to destroy us blew the whistle on
what we knew was happening to our children.
The question that is uppermost in my mind on this artificial
divide is a strategic one. Who can we bridge the divide in a way
that brings in and strengthens the work being done by isolated
black professionals without allowing them

It is an important question because it is clear to anyone who has
looked at the history of past black struggles that we need to
conduct our campaign on a broad front. We need activists and
organisers, and we need historians and lawyers. We need research
not only into the legal case for reparations but the documentary
proof of the involvement of individuals and companies in slavery.
And in the search for this information in the towns and cities
of Britain all of our community will need to be involved. The
skilled academic researchers will need to share their knowledge
of research techniques with us so that we can go to the libraries
and companies to get the evidence we need to make our claim.
