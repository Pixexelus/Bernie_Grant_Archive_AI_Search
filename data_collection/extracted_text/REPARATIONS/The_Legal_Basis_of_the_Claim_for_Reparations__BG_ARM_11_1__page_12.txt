we can prove unjustly benefitted
from carrying on slavery and other
forms of unjust exploitation will be
asked to make Reparations to those
who suffered.
6. Is the demand for Reparations
another way of asking for foreign
aid?
No. The demand for foreign aid is
being made by some governments.
on the grounds of compassion. We
are asking for reparations on the
grounds of justice and equity.
7. Have we got any authentic
evidence on which we can base
that claim?
There exists evidence in writing,
letters, bills of sales, in some cases
details such as the names of slave
ships, buyers and sellers. There is of
course the existence of artifacts
taken away from the colonies now in
the metropolitan countries and other
bits of evidence from which the
claims can be made out. But we are
also working on further
substantiating these claims; And
BA
there is still a lot of work to be done.
8. Is there any precedent?
There is a list of precedents to this
type of claim. Let us mention a few.
The State of Israel receives millions
every year from Germany as
Reparations for the suffering of Jews
under the Nazi oppression during the
holocaust. The Koreans received
Reparations from the Japanese for
the cruelties perpetrated upon them.
There is in fact still a claim
outstanding with regard to Korea's
'Comfort Women'. The Indians
received compensation from the
United States. And Iraq was ordered
to pay Reparation to Kuwait, the
richest country on earth. for or A
damages. There are others.
9. Are we asking for money?
This claim goes far beyond a request
for payment in monetary terms. We
cannot evaluate the price of
hundreds of thousands of lives and
even more for human
dehumanization, shame and
suffering. We are asking for an
acknowledgement by those enriched
from slavery and colonialism of their
guilt in this respect, a confession of
their complicity, an apology, and the
natural consequences of all these
include monetary compensation.
10. Is this a race question?
No. This a question of justice and
there are people on both sides of the
colour line who support our cause.
11. How much money are we
asking for?
As stated above, money is not the
main objective but certain payments
need to be made, to build
universities, roads, houses, and to
transfer technology, et cetera. A
special Committee is already working
out details based upon the actual
losses and what will get Africa and
peoples of African descent moving
again. Such payments will also relate
similar to payments and other
precedences of reparations such as
those made to Kuwait, Israel et
cetera.
12. Is there any legal base to
support the present demand?
Our case is based on morality and
equity, but it also supported in
international law. There is a principle
in law known as unjust enrichment: if
one party becomes enriched as a
result of a wrong done to another
party, the law compels the former to
make an adjustment to the latter.
There are in various Conventions,
such as the Geneva Conventions or
the Human Rights Convenants, of
the United Nations, clearly laid down
prohibitions against the denial of
human rights.
This is not a matter which
necessarily has to be taken before
ordinary courts of law. The
conscience of the world is a peoples'
tribunal, and it would certainly give
support to the experts pursuing this
matter.
13. Should the present
generations be held responsible
for the wrong doings of their
ancestors?
We are not to penalize the present
generations who are descendants of
slave-owners and slave-traders.
What we put before the world is the
fact that certain countries today and
certain sections of the present
generation are placed in a better
position, economically, politically and
socially than the claimants, as a
result of the unjust enrichment
enjoyed by their ancestors at the
expense of claimants.
14. Is the aid already paid to
Africa not enough to settle claim?
Not at all. Even if foreign aid is
accepted as part of the returns form
the western world, the total
investment is still only an
infinitesimal part of the value of what
they have extracted from Africa, and
from the enforced labour of peoples
of African descent.
15. How do we ensure that any
repayments do not end up in
private pockets?
The Group of Eminent Persons will
ensure full accountability in every
respect. Furthermore, much of the
Reparations will not be in terms of
