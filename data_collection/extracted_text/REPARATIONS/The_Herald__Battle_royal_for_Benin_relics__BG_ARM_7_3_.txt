Glasgow museum director rejects request from Africa for return of looted artefacts
Battle royal for Benin relics
EXCLUSIVE
By ALISON HARDIE
THE director of a Scottish
museum was at the centre of
in international row last night
over the rights of a small
African nation to reclaim royal
artefacts plundered by British
colonial troops a century ago.
A formal request by the King
of Benin for the return of 22
bronze and ivory relics before
the anniversary of their theft
in February has been rejected
by Mr Julian Spalding, the
lirector of Glasgow's muse-
ums.
The struggle to wrest the
pieces from Kelvingrove Art
Gallery, where they sit in a
glass case, has been taken on
by Mr Bernie Grant MP, who is
also the chairman of the Africa
Reparations Movement.
He maintains the controver-
sy echoes Scotland's own fight
to have the Stone of Destiny
returned from Westminster,
granted only last year by the
Government..
He has the endorsement of a
local Labour MP, Mr George
Galloway and, it is understood,
the tacit support of Glasgow
City Council, which has been
advised by Mr Spalding not to
comply with demands of the
Benin royal family.
Mr Grant is in the city this
weekend to champion his
cause and to call on Scots to
look to their own feelings of
national identity to under-
stand what motivates the roy-
als of Benin, which neighbours
Nigeria in west Africa.
Yesterday, as he viewed the
Benin collection, Mr Grant was
involved in an amicable but
heated meeting with Mr Mark
O'Neill, the museum's head of
curatorial services.
Most of the Benin religious
and cultural objects currently
in British museums and other
institutions were looted in
February 1897 from Benin City
during the battle to carve up
Africa into spheres of influence
Mark O'Neill puts the point of view
by the major European powers.
Mr Grant, who appeared
genuinely moved when shown
the majestic carved relics, said:
"These belong to a living cul-
ture and have a deep historic
and social value which goes far
beyond the aesthetic and mon-
etary value which they hold in
exile.
of the museum to MP Bernie Grant in front of the Benin exhibit.
"For many years now, there
has been a demand for these
religious and cultural objects
to be returned to Benin and, as
the centenary of their looting
approaches, the strength of
feeling around this has intensi-
fied."
There are precedents that
would allow Glasgow to return
the relics to Benin. In 1992, abo-
riginal human remains were.

with native Americans led to
the return of a Sioux Ghost
Shirt, a garment taken from
the body of a brave after the US
Army slaughtered more than
200 men, women, and children
in 1890.
The largest collection of
Benin relics in Britain is held
at the Museum of Mankind in
London, which refuses to enter
into discussions about their
return.
Mr Grant, who was acting as
a spokesman for the Benin
royal family, said: "I am not
saying that all of them should

be taken away, only the signif-
icant ones.
"The Scots set a lot of store
on the Stone of Destiny. Now
that it has been returned I
think the rest of the world will
see the Scots as being two-
faced if they are quite happy to
I have their relic returned but
not do the same themselves.
These belong
to a living
culture and
have a deep
historic value.
Bernie Grant
Mr Grant said the relics are
part of a "surviving and living
culture" that relies on them as
a guide to traditional cere-
monies and dress.
"The Africans draw and
make sculptures to consult
rather than write things down,
many ceremonies are now not
being performed satisfactorily
because many of the bronzes
are missing," he said.
Mr O'Neill said the museum
had a "moral imperative to pre-
serve the heritage of Glasgow
and enlighten local people
about Benin".
However, Mr O'Neill said the
museum could be sympathetic
to the request despite Mr
Spalding's letter, which states:
"Though it is possible for our
museum service to restitute
items. . . we cannot advise the
City Council that this should
happen in this case. . . these
artifacts have an important
role to play in the public sec-
tor."
Mr O'Neill said he would
have to be convinced by an
independent expert that Glas-
gow's collection was unique
before restitution could be con-
sidered. He told Mr Grant: "If
we went through every object
and assessed how it got here,
then we could be in a situation
where we were repatriating 60
or 70% of our collection and I
don't think society has reached
that stage.
"The bottom line here is that
were are not in the business of
redressing historic wrongs."
