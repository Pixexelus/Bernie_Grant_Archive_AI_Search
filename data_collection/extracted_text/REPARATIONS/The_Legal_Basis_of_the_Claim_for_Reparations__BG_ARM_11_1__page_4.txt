parts of the world. Much of my
work has concerned the manifold
injustices which are caused by the
evil of racism. Especially, I have
stood in solidarity with Black people
in Britain in their bitter and continuing
struggle for equal rights, and with the
liberation movements of
Mozambique, Angola, Guinea-dnublandlords or employers to put up

I believe that the cause of
Reparations to African and Africans
in the Diaspora is rooted in
fundamental justice - a justice which
over-arches every struggle and
campaign which African people have
waged to assert their human dignity.
For the iniquities perpetrated against
African people today - whether in
South Africa by the apartheid regime,
in Mozambique and Angola by
terroristic forms of destabilization, in
Britain and the USA by racist attacks
and by systems of discrimination -
are the continuing consequences,
the damages as lawyers would say,
flowing from the 400-years-long
atrocity of the slave system.
For me as a lawyer it is essential to
locate the claim for Reparations
within a framework of law and
justice. If this were merely an appeal
to the conscience of the white world,
it would be misconceived. For while
there have been many committed
individuals and movements of
solidarity in the white world, its
political and economic power centres
have evidenced a ruthless lack of
conscience when it comes to Black
and African peoples.ms
But in my experience progress has
been made when the powers that
For example, it used to be perfectly
legal in Britain, only 25 years ago, for
notices which said "VACANCIES -
NO COLOUREDS". Today any
employer who discriminates on racial
grounds can be required by a
Tribunal to pay compensation.d
At an international level, apartheid in
South Africa used to be regarded as
an internal affair, however
regrettable. But over the years
apartheid became recognized as a
crime against humanity and a threat
to peace, so that international
sanctions could be imposed.
This is not to say that the
achievement of legal sanctions"
brings automatic justice. This has not
happened either in Britain or South
Africa. But these examples show that
the demand for justice and legality is
an essential element in the struggle
for a just cause.
So it is with the claim for
Reparations. Indeed, once you
accept, as I do, the truth of three
propositions:-
(a) that the mass kidnap and
enslavement of Africans was
the most wicked criminal on
enterprise in recorded human
history,
(b) that no compensation was
ever paid by any of the
perpetrators to any of
the sufferers, and
(c) that the consequences of the
crime continue to be massive,
both in terms of the enrichment
of the descendants of the
perpetrators, and in terms of
the impoverishment of Africa
and the descendants of
Africans,
then the justice of the claim for
Reparations is proved beyond
reasonable doubt.
To those who may say, that that is all
very true in theory, but that in
practice there is no mechanism to
enforce the claim, or no willingness
of the white world to recognize it, I
would answer with a latin legal
maxim: ubi jus, ibi remedium: where
there is a right, there must be a
remedy. An injustice without a
remedy is abhorred by lawyers like a
vacuum is abhorred by nature. Once
the claim is well-founded in legal
principle, and well-recognized by the
international community, remedies
and mechanisms will be found.
Even so, given the unique, massive
and multi-faceted nature of the claim,
international jurists will be needed
who can show corresponding
creativity and imagination.
International law has never been
static. New structures have often
been devised to give effect to
recognized principles. The
Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal is
an example of new legal thinking
which brought a measure of justice
following the atrocities of Nazism.
The International Court of Justice,
where states could settle disputes
with each other by law rather than by
war, was unknown at the start of this
century.
This paper is an attempt to
conceptualize a legal framework for
the formulation and prosecution of
the claim for Reparations. It is urged
by reference to to seven fundamental
propositions.
