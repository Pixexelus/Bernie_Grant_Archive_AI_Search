Dear Bernie,
Inquiry
Please accept our Ras Tafari greetings and best wishes, how are you since we last met?
InI have visited Ethiopia for the "Battle of Adwa centennial" Inl presented a paper on the
events leading up to Adwa to the Institute of Ethiopian studies. InI also invited musicians from
Jamaica to do the largest reggae music concert so far in Addis Ababa, everything went well and
the people danced in the streets.
During Inl time in Ethiopia Inl met Patriarch Abuna Pawlos Head of the Ethiopian Orthodox
Church, InI discussed the "Looting of the Church by the British Army in 1868", and the
property in London today. This case is not generally known in Ethiopia not even in the clergy, as
a result InI recommended a public inquiry be held so as to bring the facts to light.
InI have booked the Brixton Town Hall, Lambeth, on 7th September 1996 from 11am til 10pm
when InI wish to cover as much ground as possible.
Because of your position of Chair of the ARM, a member of the House of Commons and your
status in the community being one of Inl champions can you please Chair or co Chair this
inquiry either the morning or afternoon session? Ini have sent you a poster please confirm
as soon as possible, Phone/Fax 0171 735 0905. please help us.
One God, One aim, One destiny.
