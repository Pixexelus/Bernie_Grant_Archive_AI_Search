Further to communication with Mr J.S Smith and Mr J.L Hartley of
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and the debate in the
House of Commons dated June 30th 1871, concerning the Crown and
Chalice of the Abuna of the Ethiopian Church, Looted from Ethiopia
by British and Indian Troops, under the command of General Sir
Robert Napier in April 1868, during an expedition that cost
the treasury Â£9,000,000, (nine million pounds). This most
savage rape of our Church took place after the objectives
and purpose of the mission was completed. In 1965 Her Majesty
Queen Elizabeth II returned the Royal Cap and the Imperial Seal
of Emperor Theodore to Ethiopia.
We are now seeking to recover our most sacred and consecrated
inheritance from the British Government, how can you help us?

the Magdala Properties within the jurisdiction of the courts

2. We have reccommended a solution to this urgent business by
means of a Government sponsored Haile Selassie I, Property Bill,
based upon the original 1938 Haile Selassie I Property Bill.

3. We are seeking your support in this matter as over one hundred
twenty six years have passed, and many generations have died.

importance to the future development of our Ras Tafari Community,
