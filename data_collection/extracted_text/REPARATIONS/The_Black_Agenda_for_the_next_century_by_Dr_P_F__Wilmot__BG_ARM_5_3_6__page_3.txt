NO ACCUMULATION OF WEALTH OR POWER IN AFRICA CAN BE
TRACED BACK TO THE ENSLAVMENT OF ONE AFRICAN COMMUNITY BY
ANOTHER. THE WARLORDS AND KLEPTOCRATS WHO DOMINATE MANY AFRICAN
OHIO SOCIETIES NOW
ARE AGENTS OF THE EUROPEAN POWERS WHICH BECAME
SLAVE TRADE,
WEALTHY
POWERFUL AS THE RESULT OF THE
COLONIALISM AND NEO-COLONIALISM. AND THE "TRIBALISM" WHICH THEY
PRACTICE IS A VERY MODERN
OF THE RACISM WHICH THEY
FORM OF
INHERITED FROM THEIR FOREIGN MASTERS, WHICH THEY USE TO JUSTIFY
THE LOOTING OF THEIR OWN COUNTRIES. MOBUTU WAS IMPOSED BY THE
CTA AFTER TWO THIRDS OF THE PEOPLE OF ZAIRE VOTED FOR PATRICE
LUMUMBA.

COUNTRY THROUGH METHODS REMINISCENT OF THE SLAVE RAIDERS WHO SET

ROYALTY, NOBILITY AND MERCHANTS, AND THE MASSES WERE GENERALLY
ACWORSE
WORSE OFF THAN THE AFRICAN POOR.
THE EUROPEANS WERE NOT
OWT ATTRACTED TO AFRICA BECAUSE IT WAS POOR, BUT BECAUSE IT WAS RICH
IN GOLD, SILVER, PRECIOUS STONES, SPICES AND, ABOVE ALL, HUMAN
LABOUR.
AFRICANS WERE ALSO NOT CONSIDERED INFERIOR TO EUROPEANS

ENSLAVEMENT OF JEWS, MOSLEMS AND HERETICS BECAUSE OF FEAR THAT
THEY WOULD CONVERT FELLOW-SLAVES TO THEIR RELIGIONS.
