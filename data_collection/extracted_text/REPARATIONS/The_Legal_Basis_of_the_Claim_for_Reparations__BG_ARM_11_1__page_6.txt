Most of the case law on reparations
concerns the compensation for
specific losses, such as the
destruction of property, buildings,
ships etc. but the principle is just as
valid in the case of illegal actions on
a larger scale which affect whole
peoples. Indeed there are direct
precedents for the payments of
reparations in such cases:
In 1952, the Federal Republic of
Germany reached agreement
with Israel for the payment of
$822 million, following a claim
by Israel which was limited to the
costs of resettling 500,000 Jews
who had fled from Nazi
controlled countries. Much later,
in 1990, Austria made payments
totalling $25 million to survivors
of the Jewish holocaust.
• A number of agreements have
been made under the British
Foreign Compensation Act of
1950; lump sum settlements
were made by Bulgaria,
Poland, Hungary, Egypt and
Rumania, and a Tribunal was set
up
to make awards from the
sums made available, so as to
do justice as between many
thousands of claimants whose
property had been expropriated.
A US-Iran Claims Tribunal was
set up in 1981 for a similar
purpose.
Japan has made reparation
payments to South Korea for
acts committed during the period
of invasion and occupation of
Korea by Japan.
• Most recently, the United Nations
Security Council has passed a
resolution, binding in
international law, requiring Iraq
to pay reparations for its
invasion of Kuwait.
It is therefore clear that the concept
of reparations is firmly established
and actively pursued by states, on
behalf of their injured nationals,
against other wrongdoing states.
In addition, one can identify a second
category of reparations which is of
great relevance. This is where a
state has accepted the responsibility
to make restitution, not just to other
states, but to groups of people within
its own borders whose rights had
been violated.
• In 1988 the United States
Congress passed the Civil
Liberties Act, which was
designed to make restitution to
Japanese Americans in respect
of losses brought about by "any
discriminatory act the US
Government... based upon
the individual's Japanese
ancestry" during the wartime
period when Japanese
Americans were interned in great
numbers. A Commission was
set up to investigate claims. A
total of $1.2 billion, or about
$20,000 for each claimant, was
paid. The Act began by stating
the basis for reparations in clear
terms which could be applied
with the greatest relevance to the
claims of African peoples:
"The purposes of the this Act are to:
(1) acknowledge the fundamental
injustice of the evacuation,
relocation and internment of
US citizens and permanent
resident aliens of Japanese
ancestry during World War II.
(2) apologize on behalf of the
De people of the US...
(4) make restitution to those
individuals of Japanese
ancestry who were interned...
(7) make more credible and
sincere any declaration of
concern by the US over
violations of human rights
committed by other nations".
⚫ Similar provision was made for
restitution to the Aleut residents
of various Alaskan islands "in
settlement of US obligations in
equity and at law, for injustices
suffered and unreasonable
hardships endured while those
Aleut residents were under US
control".
• Some steps have been taken to
recognize the rights to restitution
of indigenous peoples whose
land was plundered and
occupied, and whose people
were decimated, especially in the
Unites States, Canada, New
Zealand and Australia. Each of
these countries have made land
rights settlements and/or
financial payments to indigenous
peoples. These are woefully
inadequate gestures, given the
atrocities committed in those
countries against indigenous
peoples. But they recognize that
the surviving generations of
indigenous peoples have the
rights to a measure of reparation
for the crimes committed against
their ancestors.
3. THERE IS NO LEGAL BARRIER
TO PREVENT THOSE WHO STILL
SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES OF
CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY
FROM CLAIMING REPARATIONS,
EVEN THOUGH THE CRIMES
WERE COMMITTED AGAINST
THEIR ANCESTORS
W
hether the descendants of
the immediate victims of a
crime have a right to
reparations will depend on the nature
of the claim being made. The US
payments to Japanese Americans
were aimed at making restitution for
the suffering of those actually
interned. The Austrian payment was
