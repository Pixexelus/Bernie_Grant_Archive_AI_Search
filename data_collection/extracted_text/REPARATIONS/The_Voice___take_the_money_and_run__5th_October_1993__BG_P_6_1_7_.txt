MP Bernie breaks
taboo on repatriation:
BERNIE GRANT: The issue of repatriation is something he says he has to
consider.

on paying

to quit UK
'TAKE THE
MONEY
AND RUN'
EXCLUSIVE By Ainsley Okoro
looked set to come true.
MP Bernie Grant has lit a fuse forecast of fierce racial conflict in Britain
under the immigration issue by
suggesting that the government
should consider paying Black
people to leave Britain
permanently.
Citing recent ICM poll showing that
more than a third of Britons are in favour
of forced Black repatriation, he said that
increasing numbers of his Black
constituents are urging him to enter into
talks with the government on voluntary
repatriation.
The issue is now "a debate that will
have to be gone into," he argued.
And in the highly-charged speech at a
meeting to mark the 25th anniversary of
Enoch Powell's infamous 'Rivers Of
Blood' speech, he warned that Powell's
Mr Grant, MP for Tottenham, north
London, said a number of Black people
fed up with racism in Britain had
complained to him. They are saying to me,
"It's time we left this country. It's time we
were voluntarily repatriated."
The meeting was called to examine
Powell's 1968 forecast that by 1993
Britain would be torn apart by bloody
racial conflict unless Black people
returned to their countries of origin.
Mr Grant said he was no longer sure that
Powell had been entirely wrong.
"There was something in what Powell
said."
"I believe there is going to be a lot of
trouble in the future.'
He added: "Where as I wouldn't go so
far as to say that Powell was right, I think
he predicted something that is beginning
to happen. and I suspect his words will
come true, unless strong action is taken."
The issue of repatriation is "something I
have to consider," he admitted. "I haven't
come down on one side or the other."
People who have approached him have
said that they would insist on public
money to help them immigrate. They are
also demanding that the government
compensate developing countries for the
effects of slavery and the colonial era in
order to enable returnees to maintain
decent living standards.
In his speech, delivered at a fringe
meeting at last week's Brighton
conference, Mr Grant added fierce
controversy to an already heated political
debate.
Last month a Black publisher
sparked controversy when he
considered running an advertisement
offering Black Britons Â£100,000 to
leave the country. The ad - which was
eventually refused by UK Black
Pages - was being paid for by an
extreme right wing organisation.
Reacting to Mr Grant's remarks,
Gloria Mills, chair of Labour's Black
Socialists Society, warned that
voluntary repatriation "would be a
dangerous route to take" and play
into the hands of far-right-groups. "I
wouldn't support any kind of assisted
repatriation of Black people...in any
guise," she said.
Mr Grant later said he was only
"40 per cent optimistic such action
would be taken."
