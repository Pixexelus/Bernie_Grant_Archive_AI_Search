THE RETURN OF 'CULTURAL PROPERTY'
Demands for the return of parts of the collections of the British Museum
have consumed considerable time and energy in recent years. The Museum,
with the support of government, continues to withstand these demands and
seeks to promote understanding of its function as a universal museum
which plays a unique role in international culture.
The Museum's collections are vested in its Trustees in accordance with
legislation enacted by Parliament, which since 1753 has prohibited them
from permanently disposing of any object (other than duplicates) and has
required them to ensure that the collections are preserved for the benefit
of international scholarship and the enjoyment of the general public.
In fulfilment of this responsibility the Museum is open seven days a week,
free of charge, throughout the year. The Trustees would regard it as a
betrayal of their trust to establish a precedent for the piecemeal
dismemberment of collections which recognise no arbitrary boundaries of
time or place.
