to transform an idea into a movement, one that is for and about
the African community in Britain. We have anticipated
organisational realities for example the time it takes to agree
a formal constitution.
We have given consideration to a number of issues which we know
from our past experience as activists can cause difficulties such
as funding and at this stage have concluded that as far as
possible we will finance all running costs for the movement on
a shoe-string. We do not wish to be side-tracked into extensive
fundraising and accounting. Instead we want to get on with the
task in hand which is making the case for reparations.
How we work within this movement will have a direct impact on our
goals. We resolve therefore to be inclusive, that is to say that
we shall not seek to exclude anyone of African descent who wishes
to identify with and work with this campaign. There are many
strands within our community, our political maturity is
demonstrated by our capacity to embrace all of those strands.

The task before us is huge, it will need to be conducted on many
levels, locally, nationally and Internationally. It will require
range of skills that few of
of us have been called upon to
ɓ demonstrate in the past. In undertaking the task we recognise the
need and importance of sharing our skills and insights so that
the case for reparations includes the acquisition of new skills
by all of us that will be of use to the movement as a whole, both
here and in African and the Caribbean.
This is a historic duty, one that we owe to our children and
grandchildren, when we finally lift the yolk of slavery and its
legacy from our shoulders. Clear and open organisation is the
means by which we accomplish it.
