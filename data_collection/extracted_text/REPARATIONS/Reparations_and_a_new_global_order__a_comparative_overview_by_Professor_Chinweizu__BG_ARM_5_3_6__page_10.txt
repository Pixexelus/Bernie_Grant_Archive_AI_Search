part of the Black World, and without the possibility of holocaust.
From our perspective, a global order which failed to meet such
conditions would not really be new or adequate; it would be an
order serving us the same old bitter wine in some new bottle.
From here today, I foresee a day when we too shall get back
our expropriated lands; I foresee a day when we too shall get
compensation for our losses and our pains; I foresee a day when
negrophobia and the conditions which foster it shall have vanished
from the earth. But between now and that day, much work waits to
be done. The most serious part of that work is the work of self-
rehabilitation. And so I say: "Black Soul, Heal Thyself, and all
shall be restored to you".
I thank you all.
