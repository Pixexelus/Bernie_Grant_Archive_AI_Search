Of course VE Day represents only one part of our
commemorations of the end of the Second World War. The Government
regards the 50th Anniversary of VJ Day as an equally important
anniversary, and it is on this occasion that we intend to focus
very closely on the contribution of the Commonwealth countries.
Many of these countries made their principal contribution in the
Far East theatre and we very much hope veterans of all
Commonwealth countries will be strongly in evidence at the VJ Day
events in August.
I hope you will agree that we are doing a great deal to
ensure that the contribution of the Caribbean nations to the war
effort is properly recognised.
We would have it no other way.
