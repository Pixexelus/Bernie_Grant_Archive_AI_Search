OUTRAGE
By HARRY WARSCHAUER
A. ROW has erupted over an in-
vitation to controversial MP Bernic
Grant to attend a Wycombe Labour
Party function.
The invitation comes just weeks after
the riots involving disco fans from
Wycombe's Multi-Racial Centre and
customers from a nearby pub.
Tory Council chairman an Hampton was
farious when he heard about the invitation to
the MP, who earned the label "Barmy Bernie"
for his outspoken anti-police remarks after the
Broadwater Farm riot in Tattenham when PC
Keith Blakelock was backed to death.
"He can only make matters worse. He is the
last person we want here. It is disgraceful,"
said Mr Hampton.

"I don't know what

wonder if they will

welcome it. I would all
them a thing or two.
"We can do without
people coming here
and stirring things
up." said Mr Hampton,

the Labour Party's
annual dinner be was
quoted as saying: "In

The secretary of
Wycombe's Labour
Party, Eric Brooker,
defended the invitation
to Bernie Grant by
saying that he was
invited long before the
New Year's Day riot.
"I don't agree that
his visit is con-
troversial in any way
or that he will stir
things up after our
omra troubles."
