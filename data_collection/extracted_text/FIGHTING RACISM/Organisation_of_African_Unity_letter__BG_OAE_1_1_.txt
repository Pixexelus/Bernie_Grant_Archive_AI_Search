Dear Sir,

2nd June 1992
As one of
Britain's
the
few black Members of Parliament, I have
recently launched a major new organisation called
Organisation of Africans in Europe (O.A.E.). The organisation aims
to bring together Africans in Europe, both for their own mutual
support, and to provide a voice for Africa in Europe.
I am of the view that a forum of this kind is of crucial
importance in the context of
context of the "New World Order", and of the
advent of the Single European Market on 1st January 1993.
With the demise of the Soviet Union, and the reform of Eastern
Europe, the threat to Africa's prosperity has never been so great.
The exploitation and under-investment by the countries of the
North looks set to worsen, and Africa's prospects are bleak.
African people in Europe will also face further racism and
discrimination as a result of the Single European Market, and the
spectre of a "fortress Europe".
Given the global restructuring of the economic and political
agenda, it is vital in my opinion that Africans wherever they are,
begin to work together to support Africa, in a way which has never
happened before.
With this in mind, the O.A.E. has suggested that it would highly
beneficial if I were to attend the next 0.A.U. meeting in Senegal
as an observer, to begin the process of opening up dialogue.
I would be extremely grateful if you would use your good offices
to enable me to do so. As time is short, I would very much
appreciate your reply at your earliest convenience.
Thanking you for your consideration of this matter,
Yours sincerely,
BERNIE GRANT
