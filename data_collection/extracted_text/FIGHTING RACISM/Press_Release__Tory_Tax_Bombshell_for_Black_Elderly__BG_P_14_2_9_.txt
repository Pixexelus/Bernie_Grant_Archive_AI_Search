PRESS RELEASE FROM BERNIE GRANT M.P.

TORIES TAX BOMBSHELL FOR BLACK ELDERLY
THE GOVERNMENT IS DEMANDING PAYMENT WITH MENACES FROM THE
BLACK ELDERLY, SAID LABOUR M.P. BERNIE GRANT TODAY. MANY OF THEM
WILL SIMPLY GO HOME.
UNDER THE GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSALS ON PAYING FOR LONG TERM CARE
PUBLISHED LAST WEEK, PENSIONERS WILL HAVE TO BUY £10,000 INSURANCE
POLICIES, TO COVER THEM FOR POSSIBLE LONG TERM CARE COSTS, AND TO
PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM HAVING TO SELL THEIR HOMES TO FUND IT.
"
THOUSANDS OF RETIRED BLACK PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO FIND MILLIONS IN
THE NEXT FEW YEARS TO BUY THIS CARE INSURANCE. IF THEY DON'T, THEY
RISK LOSING TO THEIR HOMES AND SAVINGS, AND HAVING LITTLE TO
LEAVE TO THEIR CHILDREN. THIS IS SHEER INTIMIDATION."
-
-
"THIS IS A NEW TORY TAX A TAX ON BEING OLD A TAX ON BEING A
HOMEOWNER AND A TAX ON BEING BLACK. THERE ARE
PROPORTIONATELY MORE BLACK ELDERLY HOME OWNERS, BECAUSE WHEN
WE CAME HERE IN THE 50'S AND 60'S, THE RACISM WAS SO BAD WE HAD TO
BUY OUR OWN HOMES, IF WE COULD. COUNCILS AND PRIVATE LANDLORDS
WOULDN'T RENT TO US."
"
BLACK PENSIONERS WILL BE VEXED AT THESE PROPOSALS. THEIR
GENERATION WORKED HARD IN THIS COUNTRY. THEY'VE ALREADY PAID
FOR THEIR CARE, THROUGH THEIR TAXES, BUT NOW THEY'RE BEING ASKED
TO PAY ALL OVER AGAIN. THEY'VE BEEN CONNED."
"FOR LARGE NUMBERS OF BLACK PEOPLE, RETIRED OR APPROACHING
RETIREMENT, THIS WILL BE THE LAST STRAW. THEY'LL WEIGH UP THE
OPTIONS AND SIMPLY RETURN TO THE CARIBBEAN AND ELSEWHERE. YOU
CAN BUY AN AWFUL LOT OF CARE FOR £10,000 IN JAMAICA FOR EXAMPLE,
AND STILL HAVE SOMETHING TO LEAVE TO YOUR CHILDREN."
"FOR THOSE CAN NEITHER AFFORD THE INSURANCE, OR THE JOURNEY
HOME HOWEVER, THE PROSPECTS ARE BLEAK. THE COST OF ANOTHER TORY
GOVERNMENT IS NOW LITERALLY MORE THAN THEIR LIFE IS WORTH."
