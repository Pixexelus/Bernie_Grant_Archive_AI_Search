5th March 1986.
Dear Mr. Grant,
Following your Council's much-publicised decision on the
purchasing of Black Refuse Sacks, I would like to point out
that we at Orbital Plastics are one step ahead in the field
of racial harmony.
For the past six months we have been marketing a Refuse Sack
that will surely meet all of your Council's stringent require-
ments.
As you can see from the enclosed sample, it is made from
both Black and White polythene !!!!
Yours sincerely,
Q.C
