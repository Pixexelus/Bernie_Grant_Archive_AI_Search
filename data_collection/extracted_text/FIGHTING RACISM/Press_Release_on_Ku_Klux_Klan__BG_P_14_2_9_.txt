PRESS RELEASE FROM BERNIE GRANT M.P.
KU KLUX KLAN - PROSECUTE THEM NOW
4/7/96
LABOUR M.P. BERNIE GRANT, REACTING TO THE NEWS OF THE WORLD
REVELATIONS THAT THE KU KLUX KLAN IS RECRUITING IN BRITAIN,
HAS DEMANDED THAT THE D.P.P. TAKES IMMEDIATE ACTION TO
PROSECUTE THOSE INVOLVED IN IT- AND BLAMED THE GOVERNMENT
FOR ITS COMPLACENCY OVER ORGANISED RACIST ACTIVITY.
MR GRANT COMMENTED:
"THIS GOVERNMENT HAS CREATED A CLIMATE IN WHICH RACISM CAN
FLOURISH IN BRITAIN, NOT LEAST THROUGH ITS LEGISLATIVE
PROGRAMME AGAINST ASYLUM SEEKERS."
"WE ARE INDIGNANT THAT THESE REVELATIONS HAVE HAD TO BE
MADE BY THE NEWS OF THE WORLD, RATHER THAN THE AGENCIES OF
LAW AND ORDER IN BRITAIN. THERE IS AT PRESENT A TACIT
APPROVAL OF RACISM AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS IN THIS COUNTRY,
AND NO PRIORITY WHATSOEVER GIVEN TO COMBATTING IT."
"BLACK BRITISH CITIZENS WILL DEMAND THAT IMMEDIATE ACTION
IS TAKEN TO APPREHEND THOSE WHO HAVE CONTRAVENED CURRENT
LAWS AGAINST RACIAL HATRED IN BRITAIN. WE ALSO DEMAND THAT
NEW LAWS BE ENACTED TO HALT THE FORMATION OF SUCH EVIL
ORGANISATIONS AS THE KU KLUX KLAN. WE EXPECT THEIR
ACTIVITIES TO BE MONITORED AT EVERY TWIST AND TURN, AND TO BE
INFORMED AND INVOLVED THROUGHOUT. OTHERWISE BLACK PEOPLE
WILL DEFEND THEMSELVES."
"WE WANT ACTION - NOT WORDS FROM HOME SECRETARY MICHAEL
HOWARD. HIS GOVERNMENT HAS PANDERED TO RACISM LONG
ENOUGH."
