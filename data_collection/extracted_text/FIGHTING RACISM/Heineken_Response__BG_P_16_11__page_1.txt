Dear Mr. Grant,
First of all I would like to thank you for accepting my apology in response
to the fax sent by Mr. Kos on December 20, 1995, to Planet 24. My
colleagues and I, within the Executive Board of Heineken, are truly
impressed with your generous public statement after receiving my letter.
In your response you have suggested Heineken to show its good will by
making a donation to African-owned charity organizations. My colleagues
and I have given this - and similar suggestions made by a number of
organizations - a great deal of serious thought. After all we have
unintentionally offended a large number of people.
However, we feel that simply donating money will justifiably be seen as
buying off guilt in the sense that 'you can get away with anything as long
as you have the money'. Secondly we are convinced that credibility cannot
and should not be bought, but earned by the Heineken company in day to
day business. Thirdly we feel that, other than a public apology and a
correct way of conducting business, nothing can be done to wash away the
shame that has come over us.
