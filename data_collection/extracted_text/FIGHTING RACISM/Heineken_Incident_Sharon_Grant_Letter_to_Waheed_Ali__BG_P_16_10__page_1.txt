4th January 1996
Dear Waheed,
Many thanks for taking the trouble to ring this afternoon - things
were a lot clearer after we spoke. I have passed on the sense of
the conversation to Bernie, and he is pleased and proud to hear
that Planet 24 responded so firmly to the memo from Mr Kos.
Further to our conversation, please find enclosed a little
material about Caribbean Links.
The organisation is a growing one, and was formed three years or
so ago. It is a non-political, family organisation, which was born
out of a desire to emphasise the positive aspects of Caribbean
culture. There was particular concern about the fact that young
second generation Caribbean people knew little about the Caribbean
and its culture, and about the need for them to have positive
images of and pride in their history. The organisation is open to
anyone with an interest in the Caribbean of any race.
Despite its meagre resources, Caribbean Links has
Links has already
organised a number of functions, including two Family Fun Days
each year, which have been attended by several hundred people.
Also, since one of the aims is to link up people with an interest
in the Caribbean nation-wide, the organisation recently organised
a weekend excursion to Liverpool, in conjunction with the
Caribbean Community there, incorporating a visit to the
Transatlantic Slavery Museum there. This was a huge success and
shows the potential of the organisation. We did manage to get
sponsorship from Barclays Bank for this trip which I think shows
that Caribbean Links is no way out political pressure group !
-
What Caribbean Links needs is some money to employ someone to
develop the organisation, and something towards some basic running
costs. At present everything is done by volunteers, using Bernie's
office resources - not something which we want to continue.
