NEW RACE BODY FORMS TO WIN RACIAL EQUALITY IN EUROPE
A new campaigning organisation for black and minority ethnic people's rights.
in Europe has been formed: the Standing Conference on Racial Equality in Europe
(UK) (SCORE). Made up of over 40 UK organisations, it promises action and
legislation to ensure equal treatment for black, minority and migrant European
communities.
The rapid growth of racism and fascism in Europe and the growing resistance to
immigration from Africa, Asia and the Caribbean confirm the daily experience of
unfair treatment for black and minority ethnic communities across Europe.
SCORE will be:
* working for equality of condition for all European Community residents,
regardless of colour race, nationality, ethnic or national origins,
or religion%;B
*
*
*
promoting both action and legislation to ensure equal treatment for black,
migrant and other minority ethnic communities%;B
promoting legislation to outlaw harassment, racial hatred and violence
against black and minority ethnic people; and
liaising and cooperating to tap the network of groups and organisations
throughout the European Community by the exchange and distribution of
information.
The Launch of SCORE will take place on Monday 12 November, 11.30 am in the Jubilee
Room, House of Commons. Speakers, among others, will include Mr Bernie Grant MP
and Mr Tara Mukherjee, Chairman of the Confederation of Indian Organisations.
Speaking at the Launch Mr Bernie Grant MP said:
"It is important that black and minority ethnic people are aware of the pitfalls
of a united Europe. What we must ensure is that black, migrant and minority
ethnic communities are not subject to racism and discrimination and the xenophobia
that is now rearing its ugly head even more blatantly in Europe.
SCORE will provide a campaigning base for all such groups.'
