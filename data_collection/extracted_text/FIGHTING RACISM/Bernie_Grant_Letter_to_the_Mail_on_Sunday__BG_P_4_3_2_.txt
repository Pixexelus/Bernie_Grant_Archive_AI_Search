Dear Editor
At least twice in recent months you have published stories about me which
are untrue and over which your reporters did not contact me to establish
the facts.
In March you ran a story "The racist bin liner is blacked" which suggested
that I, or Haringey Council, banned black dustbin liners because they are
racially offensive. This story is completely false. Two weeks ago you
published a story headlined "Bernie's banter is baffling" which said that
I had caused uproar over a scheme to introduce Creole teaching in Haringey
schools. I have not been involved in any such discussions with anybody;
the story in fact was about Haringey Community Relations Council, a body
that I am not connected with. The CRC is an independent body, entirely
separate from the local authority: Haringey Council.
These stories, firstly misrepresent my position on matters, and secondly
suggest that everything that happens in Haringey even by bodies not con-
nected with the Council, is my doing.
More seriously, the effect and context of this misreporting panders to
racism. The Black community in Britain is not well served by the national
press. When its fears and aspirations are misreported by that press, or
held up to ridicule as they have been in the two examples I have given,
there is a racist backlash. The hate mail which I receive every time
Fleet Street misrepresents Black people, their culture and anti-racist
policies is evidence of this.
Yours sincerely
Bernie Grant
Leader of the Council
