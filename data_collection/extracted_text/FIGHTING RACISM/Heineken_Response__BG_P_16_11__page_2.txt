HEINEKEN N.V.
Executive Board
I therefore take the liberty to inform you that we will not make
contributions in direct relation to your suggestion. What I can say is that I
have in the meantime taken all proper steps to prevent recurrence. And I
can assure you that it will never, ever, happen again.
As stated in my first letter to you: Heineken denounces all discrimination
and will live up to that.
Yours Sincerely,
k. untern
for accepting
Board
K. Vuursteen
