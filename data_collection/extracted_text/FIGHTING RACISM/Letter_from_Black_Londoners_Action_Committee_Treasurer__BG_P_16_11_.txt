The "Action Committee" has re-initiate the campaign in support of the re-instatement
and continuation of Mr Pascall, in B B C Programming, which catered for the special
needs of our Black community/ies, by someone with our subjective experience. An
indication of the "racist-nature" of the B B C's intention, in addition to ousting
of Mr Pascall and his successful Programme, Tony Williams, Tony Blackburn and any
Programme, which tends to have a Black orientation have been chopped. This further
erosion of Black specialist Programmes can be evidenced by the complete omission
of Black Ethnic Programmes associated with the North East Region and significant
reductions in other Regions.
We hope that you will also consider this matter as a very serious matter with similar
implications for our Black community/ies; and that after further investigations you wil
consider it necessary to raise the matter in the House.
WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THIS MATTER TO BE IMPERATIVELY URGENT, WE APPEAL FOR YOUR
SUPPORT.
Yours respectfully,
Alphonso P Charles
TREASURER/ADMINISTRATIVE SECRETARY
