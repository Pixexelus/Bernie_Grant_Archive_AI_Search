If Heineken want to help, it would be very much appreciated - and
we'd of course publicise their generosity !
If you need any further information about the organisation then
please do let me know. It has a proper constitution, elected
officers etc., and these details are all available.
I have spoken to Bernie about the programme ideas we discussed by
the way, and he would be happy to meet with you to discuss all
this further. I didn't get your phone number by the way,
call me to fix a time to meet.
so do
Yours sincerely,
SHARON LAWRENCE
P.A. TO BERNIE GRANT M.P.
P.S. I have taken the spelling of your name from Mr Kos' fax. If
it is wrong, then please accept my apologies.
