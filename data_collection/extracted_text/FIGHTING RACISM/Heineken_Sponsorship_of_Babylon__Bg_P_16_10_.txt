Dear Director,
RE: Heineken Sponsorship of Hotel Babylon
I have today had sight of a letter dated 20 December 1995 from
your Mr Justus P. Kos to Planet 24 regarding the Hotel Babylon
programme. In the letter, Mr Kos, presumably acting on behalf of
Heineken, appears to be insisting on a number of alterations to
the Hotel Babylon show.
Point 5 in Mr Kos' letter complains that "there was a too high
proportion of negroes" in the Hotel Babylon audience.
I find it quite incredible that the racial composition of an
audience should be a matter on which a sponsor should seek to
pressurise a production company. As a multi- national company,
many of whose customers around the world are black, I am shocked
that Heineken has apparently sought to exercise editorial
influence along racist lines.
Mr Kos's letter is bound to cause outrage amongst Britain's black
communities, and I feel sure that it will provoke ill feeling
towards Heineken. I have been asked by the press to comment on the
letter, but would like to offer you this opportunity to explain
Heineken's position before this matter escalates.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely,
BERNIE GRANT MP
Member of Parliament for Tottenham
