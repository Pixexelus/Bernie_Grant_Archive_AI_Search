PRESS RELEASE FROM BERNIE GRANT MP
29/11/96
THIS WEEK'S BUDGET REPRESENTED AN ATTACK ON THE BLACK
FAMILY, SAID BERNIE GRANT MP. IT CONTAINED A DISCRETE RACISM
WHICH OUGHT NOT TO ESCAPE THE COMMUNITY'S ATTENTION.
" IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE BUDGET HITS HARDEST ITS BECOMES
CLEAR THAT THE BLACK COMMUNITY WILL BE DISPROPORTIONATELY
HIT BY THE CHANCELLOR'S MEASURES THIS WEEK."
"KENNETH CLARKE SAID THE TAX CUTS WERE FOR THE BENEFIT OF
THE ORDINARY FAMILY, BUT HE WAS OBVIOUSLY NOT INCLUDING
BLACK FAMILIES. THE LOWEST 30% OF THE POPULATION WILL
ACTUALLY LOSE AS A RESULT OF THIS BUDGET, AND IT'S A FACT
THAT THAT'S WHERE MOST BLACK FAMILIES ARE TO BE FOUND."
"THE CUTS IN LONE PARENT BENEFITS WILL HURT BLACK FAMILIES, AS
WILL THE HUGE CUTS IN CHILDCARE BUDGETS ON TRAINING SCHEMES
TO HELP MANY BLACK WOMEN BACK INTO WORK."
"MANY BLACK PEOPLE TOO FALL INTO THE LOW PAID BRACKET, AND
THEY ARE GOING TO FIND LIFE HARDER. YOU ONLY BENEFIT FROM
TAX CUTS IF YOU PAY TAX, BUT YOU WILL STILL HAVE TO PAY THE
HIGHER PRESCRIPTION AND OTHER CHARGES THAT WILL FOLLOW ON
FROM THIS BUDGET."
"BLACK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SUFFER MORE TOO BECAUSE OF
COUNCIL TAX RISES WHICH NEXT APRIL. WE TEND TO LIVE IN THE
INNER CITY, WHERE COUNCILS WILL BE FORCED TO RAISE COUNCIL
TAX THE MOST, AND TO CUT VITAL SERVICES."
"THIS WAS A BUDGET AIMED AT COSSETING THE WHITE MIDDLE
CLASSES IN THE RUN UP TO THE ELECTION. AS A RESULT, THE GAP
BETWEEN THE RICH AND THE POOR WILL WIDEN IN THE COMING
MONTHS, AND THE LIVING STANDARDS OF BLACK FAMILIES WILL FALL
FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND."
