FOCUS ON THE
COMMITTEE ON
CIVIL LIBERTIES AND
INTERNAL AFFAIRS
The European Parliament deals with
most of its workload within specific
specialist committees which play a key
role in Parliament's work in the for-
mulation of reports and amendments
which later come before Parliament
during plenary sessions in Strasbourg.
Of these 20 or so committees, includ-
ing the Social Affairs Committee, the
Development Committee and the
External Relations Committee, a new
committee was recently established
and its work is of increasing relevance
to organisations and individuals
involved in race equality issues.
The Committee on Civil Liberties and
Internal Affairs was set up in January
1992 to look at issues arising out of
the Maastricht Treaty which relate
specifically to the formulation of Com-
munity policy on human rights and
civil liberties in the Community, the
fight against racism and xenophobia,
asylum, immigration, external border
controls, "third country nationals,"
drug addiction and fraud, prisons, cus-
toms, policing and EUROPOL. Under
the Committee's Chairman the British
Conservative Amedee Turner and his
Vice-President Constantinos Tsimas,
the Committee of 30 members con-
venes during 2 days in Brussels prior
to the Strasbourg session to debate
the reports to be put before plenary
sessions and before the various party
groups. Active British MEPS on the
Committee include Eddy Newman,
Michael Elliott, and Christine Crawley.
Current issues debated in Committee
include the Cooney Report on the
Harmonisation of Asylum procedures
in the EC, the De Piccoli Report on
the Upsurge in Racism and Xenopho-
bia, the Tsimas Report on External
Borders and Freedom of Movement,
the Van den Brink Report on a Euro-
pean Immigration Policy, and the 2
Van Outrive reports, one on Schengen
and one on EUROPOL.
The Committee on Civil Liberties and
Internal Affairs of the Parliament is at
the very heart of the current issues
decision-making about race equality.
Although the Committee has had a
very limited role in controlling the
work of the secret and unaccountable
Schengen and TREVI working groups,
it is a body that can serve as an influ-
ence to national parties and as a pow-
erful lobby for policies affecting Black
people in Europe today.
