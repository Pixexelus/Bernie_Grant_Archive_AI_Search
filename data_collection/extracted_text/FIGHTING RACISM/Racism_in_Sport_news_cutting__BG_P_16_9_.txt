Injuries spell doom for Arsenal Blow to Norwich
By Andrew Warshaw
LONDON (AP)
JUST WHEN it needs all
the help it can get, Arsenal
has been dealt two shat-
tering blows in its faltering
bid for the English League
football title.
Striker Alan Smith and
midfielder Paul Davis have
been struck down by injuries
that could wreck the Gunners'
chances of bringing the title to
London for the first time in 18
years.
Earlier this week, Smith,
the First Division's top League
scorer with 19 goals, had his
cheekbone smashed in two.
places in a freak accident dur-
ing a routine training exercise.
He will miss at least three of
Arsenal's remaining nine fix-
tures.
Yesterday, Davis was re-
ported to have suffered a re-
currence of an old thigh injury,
and could be out for the rest
of the season.
Even with a full-strength
line-up, League leader Arsen-
al has been dropping points
regularly in recent weeks
while defending champion Liv-
erpool can't stop winning and
is now only three points be-
hind, with a game in hand.
'Bad blow'
The two teams clash at
Liverpool on April 23 in what
could be a championship de-
cider. But without Smith and
Davis, both of whom have
played for England, Arsenal's
task of achieving its first
championship since 1971 may
prove too great.
"It's come at a crucial time
and it's a bad blow consider-
ing what has happened to
Alan Smith," said Davis, who
has only been back in the Ar-
senal side for three weeks.
"We are still confident we will
get the title, but these are two
setbacks we could have done
without."
Arsenal manager George
Graham tried to play down the
absence of Smith, but admit-
ted the timing could not have
been worse.
"I have still got plenty of
options available," Graham
said. "Obviously it's too early
to suggest exactly when Alan
might be fit again, and his loss
at such an important stage of
the season is a real setback
for us."
Frank McLintock, who cap-
tained the Arsenal team that
last won the title, said the only
way to success was by being
positive. Poor performances,
he said, must not breed poor
morale.
Slump
"Even if you are not play-
ing well yourself, give the im-
pression that you are in total
command," McLintock, whose
1971 Arsenal team won the
League and Cup double, said
in a newspaper interview. "I
would say that is a vital quali-
ty."
Arsenal's gloom has been
lifted slightly by a sudden
slump at Norwich, until recent-
ly the only other contender for
Liverpool's title.
Norwich, the surprise
League leader for much of the
season, lost for the third time
in four games on Wednesday
night, 2-0 at Nottingham For-
est. Norwich manager Dave
Stringer admitted his year's
chances of a first ever League
title were now slim.
"We have to rely on others
now," Stringer said. "Our des-
tiny is not in our own hands.
We have a glimmer of hope
but we have to pray that other
teams will take the points of
Arsenal and Liverpool. If I was
asked to name the champi-
ons, I would say that Liverpool
will probably shade it."
As the battle for the title
continues tomorrow, Arsenal -
with 60 points from 31
games takes on Everton at
home; Liverpool, on 57 points
from 30 games, goes for a
10th straight League victory at
home to Sheffield Wednes-
day; Norwich, on 56 from 31,
travels to Coventry.
-
Other games include Mid-
dlesbrough Southampton,
Millwall Manchester United,
Newcastle Aston Villa,
Queens Park Rangers-
Wimbledon and West Ham-
Derby.
While attention tomorrow
focuses on the tightest title
race for years, much of the
weekend's
soccer spotlight
falls on Sunday's League Cup
final, the first of England's
three main domestic trophies
to be decided.
Favourite
The biggest names of Eng-
lish soccer will take a back
seat as Nottingham Forest
and Luton grab centre stage
for what could be a feast of at-
tacking soccer at Wembley.
Last season, Luton upset
Arsenal to win the League
Cup 3-2 in a dramatic finale
that saw it snatch a last-
minute winner, and it has
reached Wembley again to
defend its title despite a poor
season in League play.
Forest, fourth in the First
Division standings and a semi-
finalist in the more prestigious
F.A. Cup competition, will
start as favourite to win a ma-
jor trophy after several sea-
sons of near-misses.
But time has run out for
one of the players who has
sparkled in Forest's forward
line. Franz Carr, its lightning
quick winger, has missed four
games with a hamstring injury
and is unlikely to start.
title hopes
LONDON (AP)
NORWICH'S hopes of a first
ever English League title suf-
fered another damaging blow
on Wednesday, when the
third-placed team was beaten
2-0 at Nottingham Forest, its
second defeat in five days.
Sheffield Wednesday and
Wimbledon drew 1-1 in the
night's only other First Divison
game.
At Nottingham, Nigel
Clough opened the score after
27 minutes and Stuart Pearce
added the second 11 minutes
later as Forest moved into
fourth place with a confi-
dence-boosting performance
ahead of Sunday's League
Cup final at Wembley against
Luton, the season's first do-
mestic trophy to be decided.
Norwich badly needed to
rediscover its touch to leap-
frog back over second-placed
Liverpool and pressurise
League leader Arsenal.
Smothered
The visitors looked full of
promise early on, with Trevor
Putney and Michael Phelan in-
itiating some excellent moves
in midfield, but Forest was too
sharp and too strong.
Clough scored his 17th
goal of the season after Bryan
Gunn blocked a Steve Hodge
header and Gunn also failed
to collect cleanly after 38 min-
utes, when Pearce snapped
up the rebound from Lee
Chapman's header.
Norwich fullback Mark
Bowen blasted a 25-yarder
against the bar after 18 min-
utes, but the visitors had to
wait until the 80th minute for
another chance when Dean
Coney's shot was smothered
by Steve Sutton.
Norwich's third defeat in
four games left and it on 56
points from 31 games. Arsen-
al has 60 from 31, Liverpool
57 from 30.
Sheffield
Wednesday
gained another point in its
First Division survival battle
and might have collected all
three but for a 77th minute
penalty by John Fashanu
which saved the game for
Wimbledon.
The penalty award, appar-
ently for a handling offence by
Nigel Pearson, was the culmi-
nation of a battery of shots by
the Wimbledon strikers before
the referee pointed to the
spot.
Wednesday looked. the
better side early in the second
half, when David Hirst ran al-
most half the length of the
pitch to score with a fierce
drive in the 54th minute.
Black British players aim for management
Black players struggled for
years against racism to make
their mark in British soccer.
Now they have become house-
hold names at all levels in the
professional game. But man-
agement is still a closed door to
them. Now they are about to
challenge the almost all-white
hierarchy which runs the sport.
By John Tufail-Ali
WHEN Gordon Bennett, secretary of Brit-
ain's West Bromwich Albion Football
Club, began the laborious task of reading
through more than 50 applications for the
post of manager, it never crossed his
mind that he was about to read a little
piece of football history.
Among many applications the one from for-
mer West Brom player Brendon Batson. was
most impressive. If Batson had been appointed
he would have been the first black applicant in
Europe to be appointed manager of a League
football team.
Forty years after people from The Caribbe-
an were first encouraged to enter Britain to alle-
viate the job shortage, and 15 years after black
footballers finally began to break into League
football, black professional footballers are
ready to enter the highest echelons of the foot-
ball hierarchy club management.
Sport of all kinds in the West is dominated
at senior administrative, coaching and manage-
rial levels by white males. Before the Seven-
ties, the only genuine black "star" in Britain
football, Lindy Delephena, played for most of
his career for clubs in seaport towns. He was
vociferously helped by black supporters in
towns that had mercantile links with Africa and
The Caribbean.
Most coaches, players and managers agree
that the self-confidence engendered has
helped black players make their mark at the
highest levels of the game.
Garth Crooks, first black player to become
chair of the Professional Footballers Associa-
tion, explained: "Racism in the form of stereo-
typing among key occupation groups, manag-
ers, scouts, coaches and sportswriters, was
fairly common during the Fifties and Sixties.
"Despite the success of black players in
Brazil, for example, they were somehow 'un-
suitable' for the British game. They were too
'flash or individualistic', 'not team orientated.'
Black players, it was heard, 'lacked bottle.'
They couldn't cope with the 'rigours of the Brit-
ish winter.'
These ludicrous sterotypes were carried on

to the terraces via the sports pages of national
and local newspapers. They were put forward
as "decisive arguments" in sports journals as to
why black players would never make a real im-
pact on the game.
They had a debilitating effect on black foot-
ballers. Said Crooks: "Loss of confidence in a
player is just as devastating as physical injury,
and often more effective in ruining a career.
difficult for black players to develop the mental
"Negative stereotyping of this kind made it
state so important in the professional game -
the ability to dominate your position."
Today, however, these stereotypes have
long disappeared from professional football.
"The game has grown up a lot in the past
20 years," said Crooks. "Managers and coach-
es have become much more sophisticated in
their approach. They recognise the important
part psychology has to play in the game - and
they also recognise the need not to lose good
players."
However, racism persists. It continues to
have an impact on the development of black
footballers, although its most blatant manifes-

tations are on the perimeters of the game and
on the terraces, rather than among players and
management.
Terry Murphy, youth development officer
for Division One high-flyers Arsenal and a for-
mer teacher, says: "The one area where I have
really encountered racism has been in finding
lodgings for young black apprentices.
"Responses such as 'I wouldn't mind my-
self, it's the neighbours you know,' are all too
common. It makes it difficult to bring young
black players from outside the area into the
club."
Garth Crooks identified another area of ra-
cism: the press. He was particularly bitter
about the coverage of a recent FA Cup game
between West Ham United and Arsenal, in
which several black players participated.
A reporter covering the match, won through
a goal by West Ham's young black striker, Le-
roy Rosenoir, chose to use blatant voodoo im-
agery as a metaphor for the West Ham victory.
Punning Rosenoir's name, the writer called
him a "black rose" ("a dark omen in French
West Africa as the footballer from Sierra Leone
cast his fateful shadow over Highbury last
night") and said players "stood as if suddenly
transfixed by pins jabbed into their effigies."
Daily Mail Sports Editor, Peter Moss, ex-
pressed surprise that the article may have
caused offence. The article was "only a joke"
adding that he thought that "anybody finding
offence in the story must be looking for trou-
.ble."
But perhaps the most revealing comment
Moss made was: "Didn't you think it odd, the
way the Arsenal defence just froze when Ro-
senoir scored?" He concluded: "The article is
definitely not racist, not in any way."
Both Crooks and the Commission of Racial
Equality (CRE) begged to differ. "It was a dis-
graceful piece of journalism," said Crooks. "We
shall be writing to Mr Moss expressing our dis-
approval in the strongest possible terms," said
the CRE.
Today the almost exclusively white hierar-
chy in football is about to face a new chal-
lenge. Said Crooks: "The game's management
is moving near to the days when the genera-
tion of black players I grew up with, will wish to
move into management. Already at least one
player has applied for a job at his old club".
Crooks believes it is inevitable that a black
manager will emerge. Brendon Batson, now
deputy chief executive of the PFA, has made
little secret of his desire to move into manage-
ment.
Another possible is the Bournemouth and
former England striker, Luther Blisset. At Cov-
entry another black striker, Cyrille Regis, has
already been appointed into a coaching posi-
tion often considered the first step into man-
agement.
Crooks and Batson have already gone
some way towards opening the door into ad-
ministration for black players. Crooks has rap-
idly acquired the administrative and diplomatic
skills essential to his post and has achieved
real stature.
Ability
He recognises he has a special responsibil-
ity: "I'm sure there must be one or two people
out there just waiting for me to fall flat on my
face, so they can say 'it was bound to happen'.
The most important element in racism is fear,
insecurity and personal inadequacy".
Batson points to the American experience
where, although at least 50% of gridiron foot-
ballers are black, administrative and coaching
is dominated by whites.
The signs are promising that British football
will not follow the pattern of gridiron football in
the US. The next few months or years will tell.
When black footballers do break into man-
agement, they will do so purely on the basis of
their own ability, which they have forced the in-
sular, almost claustrophobic, world of football
to acknowledge. They will also have delivered
another blow in the battle against racism and
prejudice.
