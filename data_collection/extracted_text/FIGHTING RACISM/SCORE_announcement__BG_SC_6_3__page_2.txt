liaise and cooperate with all groups and organisations
with equivalent aims throughout the European Community.
Membership is open to all organisations which support the aims
and objectives of SCORE (UK). I am writing as Chair of the
Standing Conference
Conference to invite your organisation to take up
membership, and to attend the inaugural meeting, which will
take place on Saturday 24th. November 1990 in Birmingham.
Membership will allow you to play a full part in a positive
campaigning organisation working for real action on issues of
growing importance to black and ethnic minority groups
throughout Europe. A fast and efficient information service
will provide member organisations with the information on the
developments in Europe which are increasingly affecting the
lives of black people in Britain.
I sincerely hope you will want to be part of this important
initiative.
