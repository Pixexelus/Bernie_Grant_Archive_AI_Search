OPENING TIMES -
Chronicling the black contribution to
civilisation and culture
What is the common link between Samuel
Taylor Coleridge, Aesop and Cleopatra?
Answer: they were all black. If you think
you've had your historical facts right then
you might have another thing coming if you
care to visit the Sam Uriah Morris Society
in Clapton, east London, where an exhibi-
tion of the black contribution to civilisation
attests to a wealth of information that is
hardly ever revealed.
People arc told
Pythagoras was the
father of Mathema-
tics and Hippocrates,
the Father of Medici-
ne. But the pyramids
were actually a result
of planned logical
mathematical calcu-
lations, suggesting
that maths originated
in Egypt ages before
anyone thought of
Pythagoras.
The pyramids are
no longer considered
mere fancy
to be
structures to appease
weary tourists eager
for some history and
some
exotic
snap
shots. Scientific and
historical informa-
tion tells a different
story. Originally,
they were said to
have been covered
with polished limes-
that reflected
tone
the floating clouds..
Conquerors stripped
the pyramids of their
outer slabs.
2000 years before
the birth of Hippo-
crates, medicine was
by Prasanna Probyn
practised in Ancient
Egypt. Imhotep is
said to have been a
practiotioner with re-
medies for most
maladies. Ralph
Straker, the Honor-
ary Secretary and a
founder member of
the Sam Uriah Mor-
ris Society, painstak-
ingly relates the tales
behind the pictures,
artefacts and photo-
graphs.

Coming
King Jaja, Straker
said: "When I was a
boy growing up I
used to hear the song.
which went: 'King
Jaja won't let Becky
alone. This was in
Barbados. Then I
thought it was a ficti-
tious song. Five
years ago I learnt he
was real." The Brit-
ish divested Africa of
its raw materials,
made them into con-
sumer products and
sold them to Nigeria
at exorbitant prices.
King Jaja com-
plained about this
and was banished to
Barbados where he
fell in love with a girl
called Becky.
Chemistry, dentis-

cosmetics, libraries,
and even theology

Exhibits on display at the Sam Uriah Morris Society
are all associated
with early Africa.
Ethiopia was the pre-
sumed site of the bib-
lical Garden of Eden.
It is referred to in
Genesis 2
as
Euthiop, the coun-
try's ancient name.
The name of St
Augustine turns up
in connection with
classical theological
writings. His books
'City of God' and
'Confessions of
Saint' are still held in
high regard by
theologians. Little do
we know that he ori-
ginated in Hippo -
North Africa. Says
Straker: "Hitler was
talking of the pure
a
alien
race trying to rid
Germany of
blood, yet St Morris,
the patron saint of
Germany is a black
man. It makes
non-
sense of all that Hit-
ler was trying to do."
The unsung black
heroes of yesteryears
are numerous. Lewis
Latimer in the early
19th
century in-
vented the electric
bulb but
poverty
forced him to sell the
rights to Edison.
Similarly, traffic
lights, gas masks, the
idea of a white cane
for the blind were all
innovations of Gar-
rett Morgan. Charles
Drew is said to have
been the brain be-
hind the division of
blood into groups.
