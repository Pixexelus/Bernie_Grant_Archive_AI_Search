Dear Berni
I am now in a position to send you a substantive reply to your letter of 23rd
June 1989 with which you enclosed correspondence and other documentation
which you had received from an organisation called "English Solidarity".
These documents have been considered with care by lawyers in the
Headquarters of the Crown Prosecution Service and myself.
While many people will find them thoroughly offensive the Crown Prosecution
Service are quite satisfied that these publications do not breach the provisions
either of Part 3 of the Public Order Act 1986 or the Malicious Communications
Act 1988 and that in consequence no further action in this matter would be
appropriate. I am in full agreement with their decision.
