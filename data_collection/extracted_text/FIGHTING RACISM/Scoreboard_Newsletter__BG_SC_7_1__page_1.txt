EDITORIAL
History will correctly judge 1992 as a year of set-backs for racial equality in
Europe. This situation wa made worse by what can only be described as a wast-
ed Presidency of the European Community. All the British government could
offer during its six months Presidency of the European Community is the racist
Asylum and Immigration Appeals Bill (Anti-Black Family Bill) and, in respect
of the free movement of persons under Article 8a of the Single European Act,
the government still maintains that "...checks are needed on non-Community
nationals to catch criminals, drug traffickers and terrorists and to control illegal
immigration."* To make matters even worse, the British government "does not
accept that the European Community (EC) has competence in matters of race
relations."** So where do we go from here? What is certain is that the attacks
against the 13 million Black and minority ethnic people living in the EC have
dramatically increased as we move into 1993.

In order to assist with the fight against the rising tide of racial violence,
SCORE's Alternative Summit held in Edinburgh on 9-11 December 1992 urged TOTTENHAM COMMUNITY PROJECT
the Governments of the EC to adopt the following;
(a) The immediate appointment of a Standing Committee and an EC Commis-
sioner with the responsibility for the elimination of racial and cultural dis-
crimination and the promotion of racial equality.
(b) The development of an inter-governmental Convention or an EC directive
to back this initiative.
(c) An eventual amendment to the Treaty of Rome to outlaw racial
discrimination in the EC.
(d) The right to family reunion for all those legally resident in the EC.
(e) The right to freedom of movement for all those in the Community.
(f) Freedom of establishment (ie.. secure permanent residency) for all resi-
dents of the Community.
(g) Equality of opportunity in education, employment, housing, health and
social services, and equal treatment under the law for all members of the
Black and migrant communities.
(h) The formulation of asylum policies in accordance with the spirit of the
1951 Geneva Convention.
(i) The adoption of a code of good conduct by European politicians and the
mass media on matters relating to Black and migrant communities.
