FIRST REPORTS
Bernie Grant joins the Brotherhood
CONTROVERSIAL LABOUR MP GOES RAPPING AGAINST RACISM GROUP
N KEEPING with rap's
new spirit of communal
interaction, 'Beyond The
16th Parallel' by BROTHER
(the Black Rhyme
Organisation To Help Equal
Rights) is introduced by
none other than
controversial Labour MP
Bernie Grant, the first
Labour MP to appear on
vinyl since Kinnock fumbled
his way into Tracey Ullman's
'My Guy'.
Says Bernie: "I was asked
to go along to a meeting of
rappers, to give them
support, I wasn't actually
going along to be on the
record at all, but they asked
me if I would so I wrote a bit
in about five minutes, like a
speech. They were very
impressed, because they
take a lot of time over their
raps, and they decided to
put it in. So we then started
rehearsing and they decided
it was too long so they
chopped it up into three
pieces and just fitted it into
the record."
Grant's contribution to the
record, which also features
just about every name
British rap act (with the
exception of Derek B), is
suitably blunt and
unapologetic. It goes: "The
senet
BROTHER: BERNIE impressed them
Technics
16th Parallel is a line drawn
by whites through Angola,
and the racists say that
blacks can't cross that
line... The Parallel applies in
Angola, it applies in Namibia
and in South Africa, but the
Parallel also applies in Britain
when white racists say that
black people, especially the
young, can only go so far
and no further."
Do you think that your
notoriety will effect the
record's publicity?
because I think that it's vital
for the people in the street
to realise that they have a
part to play in halting the
racism."
How did it feel to be
rapping for the first time?
"To me it's very natural. In
fact, rapping is almost a
politician's dream because
it's very political and the
medium is a good one for
politicians, I could trundle
out a few lines in a few
minutes, which is good."
"I think it's vital for the people in the
street to realise that they have a
part to play in halting the racism"
"Well, I don't think I'm
notorious, so I can't answer
your question. I think I'm
well known but I don't think
I'm notorious, so I think
people will be curious and
wonder what I'm doing on it.
But one of the reasons for
making the record - and I
hope BROTHER make a
number of other records
addressing issues like racism
and the situation with the
police- is to reach the
people in the street...
So when you're at home,
do you listen to a lot of rap
records?
"No, I don't, actually!
don't have any rap records
at all, I think someone's
going to lend me a Public
Enemy record.
"Normally I don't have time
to listen to a lot of records,
but my friends in BROTHER
are going to lend me some.
"So you never know...I
might end up a true rapper
yet."
