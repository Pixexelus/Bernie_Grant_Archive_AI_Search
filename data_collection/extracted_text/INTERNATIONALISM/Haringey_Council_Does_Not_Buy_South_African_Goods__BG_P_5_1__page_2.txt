HARINGEY AGAINST APARTHEID
• Over 1,600 people have been killed in South Africa in the
past 18 months.
• Over 15,000 have been detained.
• All meetings, even church services, to commemorate the
Soweto uprising have been banned there.
Haringey Council is opposed to racism wherever it is found
in Haringey or South Africa. For, as a multi-racial Borough,
the Council is committed to equal opportunities for all, regard-
less of the colour of their skin. The Council believes that the
fight against racism in Haringey cannot be divorced from the
fight against racism in South Africa.
As part of its fight against racism and apartheid the Council
resolved in July 1984, 'to campaign to end all links between the
Council and the apartheid regime of South Africa' In particular,
Haringey Council:-
• does not buy goods from South Africa or Namibia.
• does not invest in companies with South African connections.
• does not permit Council facilities to be used for any
sporting, cultural or other events involving participants or
organisations from South Africa who are not opposed to the
apartheid regime.
• supports the liberation movements in South Africa and
Namibia and the work of Haringey Anti-Apartheid.
