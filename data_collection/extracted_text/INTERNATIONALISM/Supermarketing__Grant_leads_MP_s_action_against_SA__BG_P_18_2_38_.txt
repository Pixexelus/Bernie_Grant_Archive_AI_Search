Super Marketing
Co-op leads campaign
for single food ministry
By Guy L'Aimable
THE Co-operative movement
this week put its weight behind
calls to create one ministry re-
sponsible for the whole food
chain.
Both retail arms of the Co-
op and the Co-operative Union
said they favoured one ministry
of food.
Harry Moore, Co-operative
Retail Services chief executive,
told Super Marketing: "Any-
body concerned with the food
retailing industry would wel-
come special attention to our
business.
And Sir Dennis Landau, Co-
operative Wholesale Society
chief executive, said the Gov-
ernment needed an all embrac-
ing food policy to cover the
whole spectrum.
"Perhaps, one day, we will
have a real minister of food,"
he said. "Ministers tend to
forget that they are not just
ministers of agriculture but
ministers of agriculture, fisher-
ies and food."
The Co-operative Union's
board had not discussed the
notion as a policy issue, but it
supported Sir Dennis's views.
"At the moment all matters
concerning food are covered by
a number of ministers, when it
would be easier to deal with
one," said Lloyd Wilkinson,
Co-op Union chief executive
and company secretary.
The movement was endors-

ing calls for a ministry of food
from the London Food Com-
mission at last week's National
Consumer Council annual
meeting in Newcastle.
"I want MAFF to be closed
tomorrow and I want a ministry
of food to be opened instead,"
Dr Tim Lang, director of the
London Food Commission,
told delegates.
He said the present system,
where MAFF liaised with the
Department of Health and So-
cial Security, was "a recipe for
policy chaos"
"Look at pesticides; the pro-
ducers' interests are being ca-
tered for rather than the longer
term health and safety risks."
And he claimed that DHSS
Circle K buys Ewens
By Mike Gunnell
CONVENIENCE sector lead-
er Circle K has paid £3 million
to former Spar Retailer of the
Year, John Ewens, for his 11
Gloucestershire c-stores.
Circle K managing director
Tony Sanderson, fresh from
completing the deal, said that
although the price seemed
high, it was a good one con-
sidering the stores' turnover.
"They take around £20,000 a
year and you have to consider
that we have bought the whole
Ewens Group company includ-
ing the stock," he said.
Mr Ewens left the Spar
umbrella in acrimonious cir-
cumstances earlier this year
(Super Marketing, January 22)
when he broke away from
wholesaler Amalgamated
Foods, saying he was "dissatis-
fied with AF's dictatorial atti-
tude".
Since then, said Mr Sander-
son, he had seen strong in-
creases in both margin and tur-
nover.
"He has been able to im-
prove margins by 2.5 to three
per cent and turnover by
£1,000 a store since switching
to Booker," said Mr Sander-
son.
"John has been able to de-
termine his own future instead
of blindly following the Spar
marketing philosophy," said
Mr Sanderson.
Booker will continue to
supply the 11 stores which Mr
Sanderson said would benefit
from increased video, news-
agency and tobacco volumes,
while retaining the grocery
base.
Mr Ewens would be retained
on a consultancy basis and his
knowledge of grocery based
guidelines on cook-chilled food
were 10 to 12 years out of date.
A new ministry would give
equal priority to consumers
and the food trade, he said.
Demands for the ministry
follow mounting concern over
guidelines governing food.
Press reports this week sug-
gested that MAFF had been
advised by its experts to ban a
milk boosting hormone
bovine somatotropin (BST) -
following fears about its safety.
"BST is an illustration of
how a ministry of food could
have considered the consumer
rather than pandering to the
whims of clearly vested in-
terests," said Dr Lang.

Butler on
cue for
Digsa
leadership
TONY Butler, planning and
business development director
at The Dee Corporation, has
been tipped as the leader of a
management buyout team for
the company's Digsa wholesale
operation in Spain.
Mr Butler, currently Digsa's
chief executive is rumoured to
be joining the board of a shell
company, Ashley Industrial
Trust, and using it as a
management buyout vehicle for
Digsa.
The sell-off of the Spanish
operation was announced by
Dee chairman Alec Monk when
he disclosed details of the sale of
cash and carry operator
Linfood to rival Booker for £90
million (Super Marketing, July
8).
Mr Butler was unavailable
for comment.
Grant leads MPs'
action against SA
By Andrew Don
LABOUR MP Bernie Grant
enlisted the help of other MPs
this week to investigate the
South African food relabelling
fraud, uncovered by Super
Marketing (March 18).
Mr Grant vowed to get a
team working after he read
Super Marketing reports in
which it was revealed South
African groceries were being
relabelled as produce of other
nations (Super Marketing,
June 24).
South Africa has been forced
to relabel because of increasing
pressure not to buy its produce
in protest against apartheid.
The Tottenham MP was par-
ticularly suspicious about the

grapes from Chile in the UK,
which he believed were really
South African. Exports to the
UK had jumped up virtually
overnight, he said.
But the Chilean Embassy
said Chile began producing
black seedless grapes in the
mid-1970s, and if there was
relabelling it was not with its
government's co-operation.
And Unifruco, the co-
operative organisation that
produces the Cape South Afri-
can brand dismissed Mr
Grant's comments.
Available export figures sup-
plied by Unifruco are inconclu-
sive. Grape exports from South
Africa to Europe have fluctu-
ated between 5.5 million car-
tons and 8.7 million cartons
over the last six years. Chile's
grape exports to Europe have

risen from 4.2 million to 12.6
million in just three years.
But Mr Grant is pressing the
Department of Trade and In-
dustry for answers and he has
enlisted the help of Euro-MPs
and Ken Livingstone, MP for
Brent East.
"It has got to be sorted out
quickly," he told Super
Marketing at a meeting at the
Commons last week. "We
need a few MPs to work on
something as big as this."
Relabelling is happening on
an international scale. It
emerged this week that New
Zealand customs had seized
£500,000 worth of dried fruit
relabelled as Spanish, and
grapes labelled as produce of
Malawi had been found in
Canada. Malawi does not pro-
duce grapes.
