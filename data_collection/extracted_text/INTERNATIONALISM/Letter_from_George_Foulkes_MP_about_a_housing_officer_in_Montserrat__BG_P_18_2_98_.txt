Dear Bemie,
Thank you for your further letter of 4 March about the appointment of a Housing
Officer for Montserrat. We have not yet started the recruitment exercise for this
particular post.
Two short term specialists were engaged for five weeks to produce strategy papers
on general and special needs housing for Montserrat. This was an urgent exercise
and no candidates from the Black Housing Associations were identified in the time
available, despite the efforts of the general housing consultant, who contacted the
Housing Corporation and the Chief Executive's Office at Ujima. Five consultants
were identified, none Afro-Caribbean. Peter Fletcher was chosen because of his
specific experience, particularly on special needs housing, and his availability.
Both the appointed specialists worked in close collaboration with the people of
Montserrat.
The strategy papers will be available shortly and I will send you copies as soon as I
can. Once these papers have been discussed with the Government of Montserrat
and the details of the technical assistance inputs required for implementation have
been agreed, we will begin recruiting, looking for potential candidates both in the
Caribbean and the UK. I would welcome any suggestions you may have for these
posts.
