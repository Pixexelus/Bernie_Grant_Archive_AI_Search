Dear Cheddi,
5 Jan, 1993
I enclose a copy of a letter I faxed to you on 11 Oct. last year
and as yet I haven't heard anything so I suppose that it may have
gone astray.
I am very anxious to make contact and to do what I can to help
out.
I have also spoken to Tony Benn who would like to come to
Guyana and asked me to mention this to you. Apparently he has
written to you recently and was pleased to receive your reply.
Would it be possible to bring down a small delegation? I would
certainly want to come to see you fairly soon to discuss closer
working and also a scheme I have for getting skilled workers and
management down to Guyana to work for periods at nominal rates of
pay. As a result of unemployment we have a lot of skilled people
who could be productively deployed on projects in Guyana.
A friend of mine, Roy Sawh, is coming to Guyana shortly and it
would be possible for your office to discuss with him any
arrangements, should you wish to do so.
All the best and I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely,
Sernie
BERNIE GRANT M.P.
