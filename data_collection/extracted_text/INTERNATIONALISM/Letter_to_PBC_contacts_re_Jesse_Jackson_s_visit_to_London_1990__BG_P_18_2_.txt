1st February 1990
HOUSE OF COMMONS
LONDON SW1A 0AA
PARLIAMENTARY BLACK CAUCUS
Dear Brother/Sister,
As you may have heard, the Rev. Jesse Jackson will be visiting
London on 3rd
5th February 1990. This has only just been
confirmed.
The Parliamentary Black Caucus is to host a joint rally with the
Anti-Apartheid Movement on SUNDAY 4TH FEBRUARY AT 3PM AT THE
HACKNEY EMPIRE THEATRE, 291, Mare Street, London E8, which will be
addressed by Jesse Jackson, Members of the Parliamentary Black
Caucus and representatives of the Anti-Apartheid Movement.
Clearly organising such an event at very short notice is very
difficult, and it is not possible to rely on the post. I would ask
you therefore to co-operate with the arrangements outlined below.
I am able to offer you one ticket only at the cost of Â£2.00. The
reason for this is that seats are limited due to the size of the
venue.
If you would like to accept this offer, please ring my office on
800-5994 to confirm your acceptance. You should then pick up your
ticket at my constituency office at 247a, West Green Road,
Tottenham N15 on Friday 2nd February, 12 noon until 5.30, or on
Saturday 3rd February 1990 12 noon until 3pm.
If I have not heard from you by 3pm Saturday 3rd February, your
ticket will then be re-allocated.
If you require further tickets, these can be obtained in person
from the Hackney Empire Box Office up until Saturday.
I do hope that you will be able to join us for this important
occasion. You must be in your seat by 2.45 prompt !
Yours sincerely,
Serie Grant
BERNIE GRANT M.P.
