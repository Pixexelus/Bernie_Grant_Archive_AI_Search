Stores declare war
on sanction-busters
By Andrew Don
RETAILERS have vowed to
delist suppliers who sell them
illegally relabelled South Afri-
can produce after new evi-
dence of sanctions busting was
brought to light this week.
The Co-operative Retail
Services is considering making
its suppliers sign a clause stat-
ing they will not “supply kno-
wingly any product that origin-
ates from South Africa" and
has been relabelled.
National grocery manager
David Messom said he would
take immediate action.
Gateway marketing director
Iain Wolsey said if the chain
caught any suppliers misrepre-
senting goods it would im-
mediately delist them.
The fresh evidence of sanc-
tions busting comes from Jo
Hanlon, author of The Sanc-
tions Hand Book, who is cur-
rently compiling a report on
the subject for the Common-
wealth Secretariat.
He said produce from South
Africa was finding its way into
the UK with the labels of sever-
al different countries of origin
including Israel, Mozambique,
and Chile.
"In Eastern Europe many
Europeans think they have
been importing Mozambique
oranges but they are Out-
span," he said.
Israel had been set up as a
transit channel and asparagus
and citrus fruit was entering the
UK as produce of Israel.
He said it was up to the
multiples to put a stop to the
trade.
"This is going to become an
increasing problem," he
warned.
His remarks were backed up
by a South African political
exile, currently in Geneva,
who cannot be named for fear
of reprisals. He said South
African fish was being sold as
Chilean. And fresh and tinned
fruit from South Africa was
being sold as Israeli.
The Anti-Apartheid Move-
ment said it planned to step up
its campaign against retailer
which stocked South African
produce.
Research officer Stuart Bell
said: "We will continue to
target Tesco but that does not
mean the others can rest on

Grant to open
Quality
Food Fair
ARGYLL chairman-elect Alis-
tair Grant will open Super
Marketing's prestigious Quality
Food Fair in London in June.
Mr Grant, winner of the 1987
Annual Grocery Trade Award,
will be at the Kensington Rain-
bow Exhibition Centre, on June
14 to launch the biennial event
which will run for three days.
Already 75 top food com-
panies have taken up 105 stands
at the fair which two years ago
attracted more than 2,000 visi-
tors from all sectors of the food
retail industry.
The show's final day will
Jo Hanlon, author of The Sanctions Handbook, calls for the multiples coincide with the presentation
to put pressure on the sanction busters
their laurels."
It was up to the multiples to
police the situation, but the
movement believed they were
being "hoodwinked", he said.
Meanwhile in Ireland, the
Revenue Commission is inves-
tigating alleged sanction bust-
ing after questions were raised
in the Dail by the Workers
Party.
Since sanctions were im-
posed against South Africa by
Ireland in 1986, imports of fruit
retailers
and vegetables from South
Africa have dwindled away to
virtually nothing, while im-
ports from Mozambique and
Zambia have increased drama-
tically.
A spokesman for the Work-
ers Party said that while this
was to be expected with the
outlawing of South African
goods, some of the increase
could be due to illegal relabell-
ing in South Africa's neigh-
bouring countries.
of Super Marketing's valued
Quality Food Awards for the
best British foods launched in
1987. Judging of entries has
already taken place.
All new products being laun-
ched at the show will be display-
ed in a special showcase and
there will be the chance to win
an award for the new product
which, according to the visitors
at the exhibition arouses the
most interest.

AF chairman Ron Jacques
said the new trading formula
did not weaken the company's
commitment to wholesaling.
"We have just taken delivery
of the first of a new £500,000
fleet of vehicles," he said.
The purchase of Scott's and
Evershed's Spar business was
proof of the commitment, and
£500,000 had just been spent on
computers for Independent re-
tailers, said Mr Jacques.
