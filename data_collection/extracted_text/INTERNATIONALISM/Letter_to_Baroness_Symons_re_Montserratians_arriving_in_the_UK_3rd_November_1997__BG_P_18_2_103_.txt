Dear Baroness Symons,
RE: MONTSERRATIANS ARRIVING IN THE UK
Further to our recent discussions about the situation of Montserratians who have come to
the UK, I feel that I must raise with you the desperate situation of many who have come
to me over the last week or so, and ask you what can be done about it immediately.
Many of those who have come in recent months are now being made offers of permanent
housing by the local authorities. The properties are largely unfurnished and the
Montserratians are faced with taking up these properties without any furniture, carpets or
other essentials. They have no money to buy these items and no alternative but to accept
the properties, but the Benefits Agency is refusing grants and loans to these people so that
they can buy these items.
I am not sure exactly what these people are supposed to do, and I do believe it is Britain's
responsibility to see that they at least have the basic requirements to subsist here. Surely
we cannot expect families to manage without beds, bedding, tables and chairs for example
as the winter approaches? Many of them are also concerned about clothing their children
and buying school uniforms etc.
I do feel that these are matters which cannot wait until the appointments you mentioned
are made in December via the Refugee Council. These are issues which need to be resolved
now either by making special provision under the social security regulations, or by
providing a resettlement grant of some kind.
-
I would be grateful if you would liaise with the necessary departments as a matter of
urgency about this, and let me know as what can be done, this week if at all possible. I have
some most distressing cases here, and I do not know what advice to give them.
Yours sincerely,
BERNIE GRANT
