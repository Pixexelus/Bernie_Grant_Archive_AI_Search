Dear Mr. Grant:
Miscellaneous
We were pleased to meet with you on our recent visit to Britain, having heard so
much about your important work for black people throughout the world, and
for the Caribbean in particular.
It is because of this, and because of your unique position in the British
Parliament, that on behalf of the Government and people of Montserrat, as
Chief Minister, I am now asking you to become formally involved in mediating
in the desperate situation now facing us.
It is no exaggeration to say that there appears now to be a serious breakdown
in communication between the British Government at the highest level, and the
Government of Montserrat. We would like you to use your good offices as
Chairman of the Parliamentary All Party Group on the Caribbean to break the
deadlock. As a Caribbean man, please do what you can to help us.
It is fair to say that the people of Montserrat are in a state of shock not only
because they have lost their homes and livelihoods, but because of the
insensitivity of the British Government. The offer of compensation so far
received is unreasonable and only 11 people has so far accepted the package.
It appears that the British are in the process of closing down all facilities here
including the hospital, thereby forcing people in effect to accept the inadequate
compensation package on offer.
