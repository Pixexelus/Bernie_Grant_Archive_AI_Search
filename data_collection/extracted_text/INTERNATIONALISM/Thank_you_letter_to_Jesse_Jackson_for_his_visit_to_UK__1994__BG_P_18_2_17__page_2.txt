Clifford Headley's visit will advance matters.
Thanks once again Jesse for everything. We look forward to hearing
from you
soon. Thanks also for your interest in the health
problem. Your words fell upon fertile ground, and drastic steps.
are now being taken.
Don't forget to keep in touch over Nigeria and Rwanda by the way.
Abiola was again refused bail yesterday I understand.
Best Wishes,
Bernie & Sharon
