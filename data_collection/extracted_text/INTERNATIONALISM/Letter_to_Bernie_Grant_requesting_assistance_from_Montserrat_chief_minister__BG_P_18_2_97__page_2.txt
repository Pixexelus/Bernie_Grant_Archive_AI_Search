Hon. Bernie Grant M.P
25 August, 1997
We would like you to come down with Minister George Foulkes, on 31st August,
but if that is not possible, then we would like you to come in your own right as
soon as possible. We urgently need someone who can speak our language, and
who can understand the way the British operates.
Please let us have your response to this request as a matter of urgency. I can
be reached on telephone (664) 491-3378/3463, fax (664) 491-6780.
Yours sincerely,
