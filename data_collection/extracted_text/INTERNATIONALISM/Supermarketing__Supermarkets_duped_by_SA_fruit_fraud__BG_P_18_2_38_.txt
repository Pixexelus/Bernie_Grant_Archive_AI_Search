Supermarkets duped
by SA fruit fraud
By Andrew Don
SUPERMARKETS in Britain
may have been conned into
selling South African fruit de-
spite their commitment to find-
ing alternative sources.
Investigations by Super
Marketing revealed that South
African fruit had entered Bri-
tain illegally relabelled as pro-
duce of Botswana.
This was confirmed this
week when the Anti-Apartheid
Movement showed Super
Marketing a 5kg box of Sun-
fresh Sultana seedless grapes
labelled produce of Botswana
which was found in a grocery
outlet in north west London.
Botswana does not export
grapes, according to the
Botswana High Commission.
The Commission's counsel-
lor in London, Sasara George
said: "It's likely they come
from South Africa."
The brand Sunfresh has been
traced to Sunraysia, a grape
growing region in Victoria,
Australia.
An Australian government
employee who declined to be

named said the subterfuge by
South Africa was widespread.
He also said a well known
brand of apple which in the UK
was labelled Republic of South
Africa had the labels removed
on reaching Dublin.
The relabelling operation by
South Africa, in the face of
world-wide abhorrence of apar-
theid, is believed to be huge
and to affect many countries
apart from the UK.
In Ireland, for example, the
situation is so bad that ques-
tions are due to be asked in the
Dail after Easter.
Workers Party MP Proinfias
De Rossa who will raise the
issue told Super Marketing:
"I've no doubt at all that South

Sainsbury's new 33,154sq ft
superstore, in Ladbroke
Grove, west London opened
this week.
It is the chain's 167th store
to use ICL scanning and
boasts 31 checkouts. By
1990 all stores will be

Its coffee shop, on the
Grand Union Canal, has
mooring facilities.
EFTPOS fillip
By Suzanne Bidlake
RETAILERS look set to enjoy
an EFTPOS bonanza with
banks paying them to process
their debit cards electronically.
The dramatic about-turn
would mark the end of a long-
standing David and Goliath
retailer-bank relationship that
has been largely responsible
for the delay in a national
EFTPOS scheme first
mooted 12 years ago and due to
go live next year.
"It would take one specific
bank to strike that sort of deal
with one specific retailer," said
independent consultant Kevin
Ashby. "Then the floodgates
would open."
Food retailers such as Sains-
bury's, Asda, Tesco and the
Co-op have an EFTPOS
capability in their stores which
experts believe will give them
the power to bring bank card
charges tumbling.
Many large retailers were
already negotiating with banks
for a debit card charge below
that for cheques, said Touche
Ross Management Consultants
associate Geoff Jacobs.
The Burton Group, acknow-
ledged as a retail leader in
EFTPOS, plans to charge
banks for use of the 1,000
EFTPOS terminals it will have
by mid-year.
It was also negotiating a fee
to process credit cards,
although banks would still levy
their higher percentage charge,
said Dr Bob Woodman, execu-
tive director and EFTPOS ex-
pert at the Retail Consortium.
Mr Jacobs said banks were
unlikely to pay retailers but
would reduce their charges be-
cause of more competition.
The banks themselves
appreciated the need for more
compromise too.
"It calls for a bit of give on
both sides," said Scott Thomp-
son, head of product develop-
ment and sales at the Midland
Bank.
Gerry Evanson, senior man-
ager, EFTPOS, at National
Westminster Bank agreed.
If retailers united over debit
cards they could set a prece-
dent, he said.
Nat West and Midland were
looking at debit cards, and
Lloyds had announced plans for
a Visa "multi-function pay-
ment card".
African produce is being sold
in supermarkets under false
labels."
He said the tonnage of fruit
exported to Ireland from Bots-
wana had risen dramatically
since January 1, 1987 the
date when sanctions against
South Africa were enforced.
Trading standards officers in
Ireland are appealing for in-
formation following the discov-
ery of citrus fruit labelled with
Cyprus, Israel and the US as
the countries of origin.
These products had
apparently been repackaged in
Swaziland and Zimbabwe,
they said.
The South Africans are able
to enlist the help of Botswana,
Mozambique, Zimbabwe and
Lesotho because those coun-
tries do not have access to the
sea and need to pass through
South Africa with their goods
Findus
for export.
The extent of the fraud is
difficult to ascertain although
one UK supermarket director
said: "I'm sure if I put some of
my buyers on the rack and
threatened them with their
jobs they'd be able to come up
with one or two examples of
this happening."
