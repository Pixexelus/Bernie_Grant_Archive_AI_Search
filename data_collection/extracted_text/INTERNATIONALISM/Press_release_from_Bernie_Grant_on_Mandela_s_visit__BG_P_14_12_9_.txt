PRESS RELEASE FROM BERNIE GRANT M.P.
12/7/96
MANDELA LEAVES US ALL AFRICANS NOW
BERNIE GRANT SAID TODAY THAT HE BELIEVED THAT THE VISIT
OF PRESIDENT MANDELA TO BRITAIN HAD REMINDED ALL BLACK
PEOPLE OF THEIR AFRICAN ORIGINS, & HOPED IT WOULD FOCUS
THEIR ATTENTION ON THE FUTURE OF THE CONTINENT.
"FOR ONCE BRITAIN ACKNOWLEDGED A POSITIVE IMAGE OF
AFRICA THIS WEEK, AND I HAVE BEEN PLEASED TO JOIN IN THE
CELEBRATION OF PRESIDENT MANDELA AND HIS ACHIEVEMENTS."
"I WAS PARTICULARLY PLEASED THAT HE SPOKE OF THE EVILS OF
COLONISATION AND SLAVERY IN HIS SPEECH TO PARLIAMENT.
AFRICA TODAY, & BLACK PEOPLE EVERYWHERE, STILL CARRY THE
BURDEN OF THE PAST. WITH PRESIDENT MANDELA WE MUST ALL
NOW STRIVE TO BOTH UNDERSTAND AND SEEK REPAIR OF THAT
DAMAGE."
"THIS MEANS TWO THINGS. FIRST OF ALL WE MUST ENSURE THAT
YOUNG PEOPLE, BOTH BLACK AND WHITE, ARE TAUGHT THE
TRUTH ABOUT AFRICA AND ITS HISTORY. SECONDLY, BLACK
BRITONS MUST STRENGTHEN THEIR LINKS WITH AFRICA, AND
UNDERSTAND THAT OUR FUTURE IS BOUND UP WITH THAT OF
THE CONTINENT. FOR AS LONG AS AFRICA IS ABUSED
INTERNATIONALLY, BLACK PEOPLE EVERYWHERE WILL BE
DISRESPECTED."
"AS PRESIDENT MANDELA LEAVES OUR SHORES, WE THANK HIM
FOR HIS VISIT, AND RENEW OUR DETERMINATION TO BUILD ON
THE RESPECT IT HAS GENERATED IN BRITAIN TOWARDS AFRICA".
