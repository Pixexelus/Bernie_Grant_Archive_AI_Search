PRESS RELEASE FROM BERNIE GRANT
M.P.
3.3.90
PLEASE FIND ENCLOSED A COPY OF A LETTER RECEIVED TODAY BY MR
GRANT, FROM PRIME MINISTER MAGARET THATCHER.
THE LETTER AROSE FROM MR GRANT'S 13TH FEBRUARY MEETING WITH THE
PRIME MINISTER ON HIS RETURN FROM SOUTH AFRICA, WHERE HE HAD MET
WITH NELSON MANDELA SHORTLY AFTER HIS RELEASE. AT THAT MEETING MR
GRANT HAD PUT TO MRS THATCHER THE SUGGESTION THAT THE GOVERNMENT
SHOULD PROVIDE A DEGREE OF FUNDING FOR THE DEMOCRATIC FORCES IN
SOUTH AFRICA, ΤΟ ENABLE THEM TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN FUTURE
NEGOTIATIONS.
COMMENTING ON THE PRIME MINISTER'S LETTER TODAY, MR GRANT SAID :
"I THE TONE OF MRS THATCHER'S LETTER IS MOST ENCOURAGING, AND I AM
OBVIOUSLY VERY PLEASED THAT SHE HAS TAKEN MY PROPOSAL SERIOUSLY."
"IF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IS SERIOUS ABOUT WANTING ΤΟ SEE
PEACEFUL CHANGE IN SOUTH AFRICA, AND ABOUT WANTING TO BRING AN END
TO APARTHEID, THEN ONE CONSTRUCTIVE THING IT CAN DO IS TO ENSURE
THAT NELSON MANDELA AND THE DEMOCRATIC FORCES HAVE THE BASIC
RESOURCES THEY NEED TO ENTER INTO A DIALOGUE WITH DE KLERK. IT IS
IMPORTANT HOWEVER THAT THIS IS NOT SEEN AS AN ALTERNATIVE ΤΟ
MAINTAINING SANCTIONS."
"CLEARLY THE DETAILS OF THIS SCHEME HAVE NOT YET BEEN WORKED OUT,
AND WE SHALL HAVE TO LOOK CAREFULLY AT THEM WHEN THEY APPEAR. I
HOPE THAT THE FUNDING WILL BE PROVIDED WITHOUT UNACCEPTABLE
STRINGS, AND ALSO THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT DELAY IN GETTING
THE SCHEME OFF THE GROUND.
"
