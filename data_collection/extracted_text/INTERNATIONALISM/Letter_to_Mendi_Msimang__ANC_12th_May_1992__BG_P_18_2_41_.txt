Dear Mendi,
Further to my previous discussions with Thabo Mbeki and yourself
regarding the need for black people in Britain to galvanise
practical support for the ANC, I am writing to inform you that I
may now be in a position to put into effect some of the ideas that
we had discussed so long ago.
.
In order for us to be able to assess the levels of need within the
new South Africa, I think that you are right to suggest that now
would be an appropriate time for representatives from my
organisation to visit South Africa to look at the situation.
are
In our view it is imperative that with the emergence of a new
Government, that blacks, particularly from rural areas
empowered to take on the vital task of building the new South
Africa. Black people in Europe are eager to both
empowerment, and to draw strength from it themselves.
aid that
What I envisage is that we would send down two people experienced
in training who would be able to assess needs on the ground, in
the first instance, and report back to our organisation. We would
fund this visit, on the understanding that you would arrange a
suitable programme for them whilst in South Africa.
I would be grateful for your early response to this proposal, So
that we can begin to make arrangements as soon as possible if this
meets with the ANC's approval.
Yours sincerely,
BERNIE GRANT M.P.
