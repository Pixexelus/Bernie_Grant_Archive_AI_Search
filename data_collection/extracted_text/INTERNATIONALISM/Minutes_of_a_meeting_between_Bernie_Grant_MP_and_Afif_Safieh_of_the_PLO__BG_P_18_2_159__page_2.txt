HOUSE OF COMMONS
LONDON SW1A OAA
Mr. Safieh expressed concern that the American Congress debate
might change attitudes once again. Mr. Grant does not think his
concern is justified as he feels that a large body of opinion in
the United States is opposed to war. He feels that Congress is
probably quite evenly split on the issue.
have
Mr. Grant feels that public opinion polls here in the U.K.
shown that public opinion here is also quite evenly split but
feels that Mr. Bush's "war-like rhetoric" is limiting support for
the war option. The anti-war meeting scheduled for Saturday 12th
January in Trafalgar Square will, in his view influence many
people towards the peaceful option. Mr. Safieh asked if Mr.
Edward Heath would be involved in this meeting. He apparently has
been invited to speak but has not responded yet.
4. Possibility of War?
Mr. Safieh does not think that there will be a war in the Gulf.
Mr. Grant feels that even if Mr. Bush does not act, Israel may
take some action.
4. Palestine Liberation Organisation
Mr. Grant asked Mr. Safieh about the activities of the PLO. Mr.
Safieh said that the group was quite active, held regular meetings
has a large pool of speakers and a community of approximately ten
thousand. He felt that one of their main problems was that they
needed improved interaction with the British community and
lobbying on a ministerial level.
Mr. Grant offered to represent them at a parliamentary level. He
was recently elected Chair of The Socialist Campaign Group and he
asked Mr. Safieh to join the group. Mr. Safieh agreed.
A discussion followed on the nature of Palestinian political
parties.
