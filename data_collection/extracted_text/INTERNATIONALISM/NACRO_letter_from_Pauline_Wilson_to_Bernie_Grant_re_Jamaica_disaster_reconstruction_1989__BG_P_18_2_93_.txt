Dear Bernie,

"JAMAICA HURRICANE
Re: JAMAICA DISASTER RECONSTRUCTION TRAINING EXPEDITION
1989
As a result of the devastation caused recently by 'Hurricane Gilbert' in
Jamaica, a number of voluntary groups, organisations and individuals
have come together to offer varing levels of assistance.
NACRO North London has been exploring the possibility of providing
training programmes which include construction skills acquisition as
part of its own relief effort. A meeting has been arranged to discuss
and formalise plans for such an expedition. The meeting is scheduled
for Thursday, 27th October at 2.00. pm. at the office.
One of the basic aims of the Training Expedition is to actively engage
and contribute to the reconstruction of Jamaica by offering real
training possibilities for long-term unemployed people both here and in
NACRO's support in the Hurricane Aid effort would be offered
in accordance with current practices and clientelle i.e. training for
the long-term unemployed and ex-offenders. NACRO's training programmes
incorporate Basic and Life skills training as well as a range of
construction, craft, administrative and other skills useful in Jamaica's
reconstruction process.
We envisage providing training for some 50 Trainees in Jamaica
initially over a 15 week period. Also 20 Trainees from NACRO North
London would work/train alongside Jamaican Trainees.
We hope that you will feel able to contribute to the realisation of this
project and look forward to seeing you on the 27th, so that we might
further develop plans for this expedition.
With best wishes,
Yours sincerely
PWilson
