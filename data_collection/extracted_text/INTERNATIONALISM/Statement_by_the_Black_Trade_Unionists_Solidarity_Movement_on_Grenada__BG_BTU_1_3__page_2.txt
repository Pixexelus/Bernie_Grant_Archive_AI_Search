We therefore demand the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from the
state of Grenada.
We demand that the USA pays compensation to the Grenada Government and to the
AGAB citizens of Grenada for destroying their beautiful country and killing its
people.
We demand the setting up of an International Labour Movement Committee of
Inquiry, including Black people in the labour movement, to investigate the
events of the past few weeks in Grenada and outside of Grenada.
The Black Trade Unionists Solidarity Movement pledges itself to fight
alongside the New Jewel Movement and any other organisation which will
support the above demands. In furtherance of this the BTUSM will:
1.Give financial, political and any other support to Grenada through the NJM.
2.Authorise BTUSM members to issue statements in line with this policy.
3.Support and organise demonstrations and pickets in support of Grenada.
4.Raise the issue within the Labour Movement urgently.
5.Contact Black organisations in the USA to enlist their support.
