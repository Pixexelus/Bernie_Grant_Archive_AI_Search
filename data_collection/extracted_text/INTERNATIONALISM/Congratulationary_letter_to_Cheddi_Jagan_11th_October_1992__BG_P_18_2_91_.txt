Dear Cheddi,

Your victory is a lesson to all on the left in Britain that
policies and principles can get majority public support if
continue our efforts, and adjust our policies to met current
trends. Your election opens up a new era for the Caribbean region,
and offers great hope, not least because of the advent of the New
World Order, and the development of huge trading blocs such as the
North American Free Trade Area which threat the region.
The new start that your election has given Guyana must be
capitalised upon, and you must be aware that all people of
goodwill can contribute. It is to this end that I offer my
support, and assistance in any way that you may see fit. There is
much that I can do to help the Caribbean from the
the British
Parliament, and I hope that you will remember that I am there to
help if needs be.
I look forward to hearing from you,
Yours in comradeship,
Sermi
BERNIE GRANT M.P.
