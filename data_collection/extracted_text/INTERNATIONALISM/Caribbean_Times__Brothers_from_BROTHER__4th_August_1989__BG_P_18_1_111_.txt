BERNIE GRANT MP, chair of the Parliamentary Black Caucus, launched his career as a rap artist last
week at a special conference heralding the release of Beyond The 16th Parallel. Pictured aside

from the African National Congress Mr Grant expressed how the rappers he met during the making of the
record and its accompanying video were far more like statesmen than the politicians he encountered in the
House of Commons. The 16th Parallel refers to a line of latitude separating Namibia from Angola and also
the point which Pretoria's apartheid army insists the freedom fighters of SWAPO should withdraw to
before they promise to allow a peaceful election for a new government in Namibia. Dumisani said he found
listening to the record to be a moving and emotional experience. "It's message will give our supporters
greater vigour while our enemies will find this record a tornado heading out to hit the Botha regime", he
stated in enthusiatic recommendation.

"People on my
