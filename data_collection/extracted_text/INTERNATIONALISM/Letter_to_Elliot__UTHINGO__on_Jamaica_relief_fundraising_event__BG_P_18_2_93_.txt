JAMAICA HURRICANE RELIEF FUND RAISING BENEFIT
20 Oct, 1988
I am
writing in connection with the above which I mentioned
when I saw you today.
to you
Clarendon
The Tottenham Labour Party is arranging a fund raising event for the
Jamaica Hurricane Relief at the West Indian Centre,
Rd.
London N8 on Friday 9 Dec., 1988 from 9pm until 2am.
I am asking whether your group "UTHINGO", could be kind enough to
assist us by playing free of charge for this charitable purpose.
If this is possible, I would be obliged if you could get in touch
to arrange any further details that may be necessary.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely,
Erme
BERNIE GRANT M.P.
