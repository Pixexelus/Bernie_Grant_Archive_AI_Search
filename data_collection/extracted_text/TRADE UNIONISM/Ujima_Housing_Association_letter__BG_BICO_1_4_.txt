Dear Mr Devine,
Re: Housing Development in South Africa
Further to our discussions with Mr. Bernie Grant M.P. about issues relating
to housing development in South Africa, I would welcome the opportunity
for Ujima Housing Association to work in partnership with the government
of the Free State. I hereby send an open invitation for you to come and
visit the Free State to discuss these issues further.
Yours sincerely,
Mr. MGP Lekota
Free State Premier
