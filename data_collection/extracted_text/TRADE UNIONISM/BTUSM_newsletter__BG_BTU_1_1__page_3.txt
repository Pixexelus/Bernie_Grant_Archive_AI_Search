EXPOSED!
On the 17th of June, over 40 Black NALGO
Workers some of whom were BTUSM members went
to the Annual Conference of NALGO in Brighton
to rally support for a motion from Ealing
branch which would put to test the rhetoric
of NALGO on fighting racism, and educate
those white delegates likely to sit through a
discussion on Racism, of the weak and racist
nature of the motion from Liverpool.
The Ealing motion called for Black NALGO
members to constitute a National Race
committee with direct access to the NEC, with
the task of promoting equal opportunity and
positive action in the trade union itself and
to draw up rules and regulations to dis-
cipline employers found to be perpetuating
racism.

THREATENED
The National Executive Council (NEC) of NALGO
threatened at the prospect of action attempte
to pre-empt Ealing by setting up their own
Race working party, which would safeguard
itself from effective Black involvement as th
power would be tightly retained in the hands
of 5 White members, two from the NEC itself,
and three from NALGO Economic Committee. All
of these 5 White NALGO officials are totally
incapable of functioning in a Race Committee
as they do not have an adequate grasp of Blac
issues.
A lunch time lobby was arranged by the Black
Workers group in NALGO, at the Old Ship Hotel
in Brighton which was attended by over 150
delegates. At this lobby Liverpool was
requested to withdraw their motion, failing
which to call for precedence, so that the
Ealing motion could be heard first.
ONE SIDED DEBATE

At the conference precedence was denied and
the Liverpool motion was passed with the full
weight of the NEC behind it. Next came the
Ealing motion. The NEC spoke at length, s
attempting to persuade voters not to give of
their support.
ONE NEC SPOKESMAN SAID THAT BLACK PEOPLE DID
NOT HAVE THE EXPERTISE OR THE EXPERIENCE TO
DEAL WITH RACE. WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR THE
THREE SPEAKERS TO REPLY ON BEHALF OF THE
EALING MOTION THE DEBATE WAS CUT SHORT, AND
ALL THE SPEAKERS WERE PREVENTED FROM
SPEAKING BY A REQUEST THAT THE MOTION BE PUT
TO CONFERENCE FOR VOTING.
NALGO CONFERENCE 14-1
THE NEC CHEATS!

To the surprise of the Black NALGO workers
sitting in the visitors' gallery, overlooking
the whole of the conference, and others, it
seemed from the show of hands that the Ealing
motion had won.
The Black workers witnessing the chairperson's
deliberate falsification of votes demanded
that a count should be taken by card vote.
This was supported by well over half of the
conference delegates who stood up. (A
minimum of 50 standing delegates required a
card vote to be taken.)

In spite of this the chairperson refused.
Enraged at the racism and blatant dishonesty
of the NEC, Black NALGO workers protested by co
a slow hand clap. The NEC ignored this and
attempted to gloss over the race issue, and
turned to the next item on the agenda.
The chairperson of the NEC promptly declared
the conference closed, as it had been
'invaded by non-delegates'.
The Black workers then proceeded down the
centre of the conference floor in single
file, whilst angry white delegates, shocked
by the incident, who had hitherto been the
first to declare themselves non racist,
hurled abuse such as, "GIVE THOSE BLOODY
BLACKS AN INCH AND THEY TAKE A MILE",
"GO BACK WHERE YOU COME FROM",
"GO TO HELL", etc.

Although the motion was defeated, the battle o
was won. The Black workers had exposed the 885
racism in NALGO for all to see. The protest
was the first of its kind, where black Trade
Unions disrupted a union conference, to alert
the white trade unionist of the fact that
black people will not tolerate tokenism or
empty rhetoric. Future action will consist
of pickets of the NEC, a submission of a
motion demanding NALGO to hold a conference
of Black NALGO members, and to set up a Race
Committee of Black NALGO members. The next
year's conference will be in the Isle of Man.
We hope to see more black delegates at the
conference, and to those who take comfort in
distance, the Black NALGO members will be
there.
