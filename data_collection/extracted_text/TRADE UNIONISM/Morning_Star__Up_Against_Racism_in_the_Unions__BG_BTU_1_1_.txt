Up against racism
THE concept of trade union
solidarity, of brotherhood and
sisterhood, has taken a mul-
titude of knocks in recent
years, but none more poten-
tially damaging than
levelled by the Black Trade
Unonists Solidarity Move-
ment.
those
In fact, according to Bernie
Grant, one of the movement's
founders, this ideal is some-
thing of a hindrance. It blinds
the
unions to racism among
their own members.
"They have this noble idea
that we're all brothers and sis.
ters, 'Workers of the World
Unite' and all that, and for
them to admit that this is not
really how it works in practice
is an admission of their own
failure at a very basic level,"
said Mr. Grant.
The Black Trade Union Solid-
arity Movement was born in the
aftermath of the 1981
summer
violence in Brixton, Southall
and Toxteth. It grew from the
trade unions' "negative
sponse" to these riots and was
nurtured by two national con-
ferences one of black wor
re-
kers in Birmingham and the
other of black civil rights law-
yers.
Full-time
Mr. Grant, who is a full-time
official with the National Union
of Public Employees in London,
and deputy leader of Haringey
Borough Council, addressed both
meetings.
"As far as I was concerned,"
he said, "the riots brought a
lot of racism to the surface
within the trade unions. In
branches, people were openly
talking about repatriation and

supporting hard-line police
tactics.
"The violence in the inner
cities also brought about a re-
awakened consciousness among
black trade unionists them-
selves. The whole atmosphere
was very tense and people were
looking for some kind of
initiative."
Experiences
Building on the experiences of
the newly-formed black workers'
groups at British Leyland in Bir-
mingham and Cowley, the idea
developed of a national federa-
ted black workers' organisation.
A steering committee was set
up which included Pat Tonge, a
National Union of Railwaymen
shop steward, Sam Springer, the
Mayor of Hackney. Nandana
Ahmad of NALGO and many
other leading black unionists.

kers and permanent premises -
the Black Trade Unionists Solid-
arity Movement was on its way.
Its inaugural conference too is
scheduled for March.
"We will be a pressure group
within the trade union move-
ment," said Mr. Grant. "We will
expose
racism in the unions
through the media and by
picketing union conferences."
He said there was no question
of forming separate black unions
because "we don't want to let
the unions off the hook"-a
hook largely of the unions' own
making.
Keeping it sharpened is Bernie
Grant's own brand of black
nationalism which has an omi-
nous, if familiar. ring.
"I look at it on the basis that
Britain is a racist society and
therefore all institutions in
Britain are basically racist, in-
cluding the trade unions," he
said.
"They've passed a lot of reso-
lutions and issued a black wor-
kers' charter but they have not
responded practically at shop
floor level to racism.
"Racism among the member-
ship stems from the fact that
workers are educated in a racist
society. They are schooled in
historical distortions reinforced
by the media. Many of them just
can't help being racist," said Mr.
Grant.
He said the BTUSM stressed
the importance of taking posi-
tive steps to counter this racism
with such things like racial
awareness courses or employing
specialists to overhaul union rule
books and expunge discrimin-
atary practices.

be
Pub meetings ought to
stopped if Asian members felt
offended by being on licensed

premises. The recruitment
union officers should also be in-
vestigated particularly internal
advertising of posts.
If unions are white dominated,
internal advertising of top posts
will only perpetuate this. Blacks
will only come in at the bottom
rungs.
Mr. Grant labelled the pre-
entry closed-shop trade unions
as racist and urged the unions to
look closely at how they opera-
ted. "It is no coincidence that
there are very few blacks in
highly skilled Fleet Street print
jobs," he said.
Holidays
When he was organising hos-
pital workers in West Lon-
don, Mr. Grant said an at-
tempt was made to negotiate
different holidays. for Asian
workers.
"The management was a bit
put out because on certain feast
days, like Ramadam and Diwali,
people would not turn up for
work. What we tried to do was
exchange the holidays.
"Asian workers were quite
happy to come in on Christmas
Day and other Christian holi-
days so long as they could have
their feast days off."
Mr. Grant said some work-

"One of the major problems
at the workplace is racism from

just not secing it," he said.
"The moment you talk about
racial discrimination, the unions
just don't want to know."
Mr. Grant claimed some
unions were afraid of losing
members if they took a hard
racism
stand against
on the
shop floor.
"This is a cold, hard fact," he
said. "But all unions in a par-
ticular industry should get to-
gether and agree not to accept
new members from other unions
who might resign if a union de-
cides on a fight against a specific
example of racism. The trouble
is, they don't do that."
Mr. Grant said black workers
often find it difficult getting
white workers to support them.
in any action they decide to take.
He said it was also hard for
black workers to get unions to
take up immigration cases on
behalf of members and to fight
for black promotions on the shop
floor.
"Instead of recognising the ex-
tent of racism on the shop floor,
the unions shove the blame on
to the management for creating
divisions on racist lines. I accept
this. But the unions have al-
lowed it to happen," said Mr.
Grant.
