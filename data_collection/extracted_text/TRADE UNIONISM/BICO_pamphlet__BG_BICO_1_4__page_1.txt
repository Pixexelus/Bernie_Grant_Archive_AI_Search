Why should I apply to join BICO?
The 'Win-Win' Philosophy
'We lease the land from our children and not inherit
from our parents.'
BICO provides a multi-disciplinary platform from
which cross sectorial as well as cross cultural issues
in an increasingly global world can be debated as
they impact on provision for the built environment.
These will be examined from the point of view of
previous, current, and future policy, programmes,
☐ and projects. The important dimension of culture
will underscore some of these debates which can
only further the acknowledgement of the diversity of
our global heritage.
BICO is the organisation to be with in order to
participate in stimulating dialogue which will help
shape a new order for the millennium and beyond
Our very existence is reason enough to be part of
such a dynamic and forward looking group.
