BLACK WORKERS CONFERENCE.
On Saturday February 7th 1981 a meeting was held in the
offices of the Commission for Racial Equality. It was
attended by 80 black trade unionists. After discussion they
decided, unanimously, to set up a steering committee with a
view to organising a conference of black workers, as well
as establishing black caucuses in the unions.
As British capitalism is restructured, more and more blacks
are thrown out of work. The problems these workers confront
are different to those of other workers.
More and more black women are forced to take up 'home-work'
which is very poorly paid. It is difficult to organise them
without a black dimension.
As the economic crisis grows so does the opppression of
black workers. Harassment increases, as well as violent
attacks on blacks.
It is in the light of these developments that a conference
of black workers has been called on September 12th, at
Digbeth Civic Hall. If you are interested, please cut off
the slip and post it to us as quickly as possible. An
agenda and list of speakers will be sent later.
I shall be attending the conference of black workers,
on September 12th at Digbeth Civic Hall, Birmingham.
