Dear
LONDON STEERING COMMITTEE
The recent riots have demonstrated that, as black pepole, we need to organise
ourselves to defend our youth and to fight racism at work, at play and on
the streets. There have been several attempts in the past to organise a
black CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT but all have failed because of splits, person-
ality clashes and lack of discipline and organisation.
The economic crisis has meant that black people are being hit hardest at
work through redundancy, non filling of vacancies and deliberate acts of
racism. The trade union movement continues to pass well-meaning resol-
utions but these have no effect on racism at work and in the trade union
movement. It is now time for black trade unionists to step forward and
organise within the trade union movement.
We have another historic task to perform. We have learnt discipline and
organisation from being in the trade union movement and have a duty to
lead the other sections of the black community into organising a CIVIL
RIGHTS MOVEMENT. At a recent conference of black lawyers, they made plans
to set up a black lawyers organisation to defend blacks and to fight for
black equality. They are determined to assist us legally and to set up
a CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. We have other black sections like Cultural,
Educational, Medical, Political etc., which will be organised in due
course. Our job as black trade unionists is to organise these sections into
the CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT our people need. Our job will be difficult but
as trade unionists we are accustomed to pressure.
Bill Morris, National Organiser TGWU, and I attended the Black workers
Conference in Birmingham on Saturday 12th September. Apart from the
Black People's Day of Action on 2nd March, I have never been inspired
as much from any other event in Britain. This was a historic conference
as it brought together over 100 black trade union activists, including
delegations from British Leyland Longbridge and the Indian Workers Assn
(GB). The conference unanimously agreed to set up a National Black
Trade Unionists Organisation. At the same time a conference of black
lawyers was being held in Surrey. At that conference, the top American
Lawyers who built the American Civil Rights Movement and worked with
Martin Luther King, explained the black American experience
and gave
invaluable advice on setting up a Civil Rights Movement in Britain.
The American brothers and the British lawyers all agreed unanimously
that black trade unionists were only people who could set up the Civil
Rights Movement because of our organisational and disciplined approach.
We can't let our people down.
