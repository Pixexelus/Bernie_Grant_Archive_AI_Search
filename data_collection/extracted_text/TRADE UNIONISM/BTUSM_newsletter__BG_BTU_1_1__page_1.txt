Declaration
We, the undersigned Black Trade Unionists are concerned
at the extent of racism in British Society and in
particular the Trades Union and Labour Movement.
The recent disturbances in Brixton, Southall and other
parts of London show the Black People are no longer
prepared to accept unemployment, bad housing, police
provocation and the institutional and individual Racism
inherent in British Society.
We are strongly opposed to continuing political trends
in the area of race relation e.g. the Nationality Bill,
the Circular issued by the Department of Health and
Social Security (DHSS) on overseas patients, the
refusal of the DHSS to pay benefits to people who do
not speak English, passport checks and immigration
"fishing raids", the calls for the repatriation of
Blacks etc. We believe that these measures are an
exacerbation of previous racist policies and practices.
aware
As Trade Unionist, the day to day Racism at the
workplace must be of primary concern to us and we
that Unemployment, Short Time Working, redundancy and
other forms of direct and indirect
affect Black People more than any other section within
British Society.
We have a duty to organise ourselves within the Trades.
Union and Labour Movement to combat racism and we are
resolved to organise ourselves in such a way that we
can promote and protect the interests of Black People
in the Trades Union and Labour Movement.
We therefore pledge ourselves to:-
1. Organise a London based Conference of Black Trades
Unionists to discuss a programme of action.
2. Make links with other Black Workers Organisations
with a view to launching a National Black Trades
Unionists Movement.
3. Work to improve the increasing participation of
Black People at all levels within the Trades Union
and Labour Movement.
4. Work for changes within the Trades Union and Labour
movement to restore the confidence of Black People.
