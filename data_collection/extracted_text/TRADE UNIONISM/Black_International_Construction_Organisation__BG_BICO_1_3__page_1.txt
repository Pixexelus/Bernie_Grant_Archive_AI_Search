RE: Black International Construction Organisation: Article in
Building Design magazine
We have received a complaint about an article on the activities of the
BICO from a constituent of Bernard Jenkin MP alleging that the activities
of the organisation are in breach of the Race Relations Act 1976.
The article concerned has raised a number of issues which we are bound to
look into for the purpose of establishing whether or not there has in fact
been any breach of the Race Relations Act.
Firstly we would need to look at the constitution of the organisation to
establish whether or not it is in breach of sections 25 and 26. In particular
we wish to know how the term "Black" is defined.
Secondly we would require an explanation and any relevant documentation
on how the service works and whether or not the service is offered on the
basis of colour.
As you know we have a number of formal powers which allow us to take
legal action in the Commission's name. Where we secure co-operation we
are able to exhaust all available options before resorting to these powers.
