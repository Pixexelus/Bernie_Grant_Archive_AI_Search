authority shake-up which may
wipe out some projects and
delay others by as much as two
years
The reorganisation of all
councils in Scotland, which
came into effect this month, has
left "absolute chaos" according
to Cochrane McGregor partner
David Cochrane, while David
Page of Page & Park fears sont
projects "just won't happen".
Cuts in funding and a switch
to Private Finance Initiative are
also causing concem.
Projects waiting for approval
and funding from new authori-
tics include Benson & Forsyth's
competition-winning Cowgate-
head redevelopment in Edin-
burgh, refurbishment of the
Borough Halls at Linlithgow by
Nicholas Groves-Raines and
the Perth civic square scheme
by Page & Park.
"At the moment things are
quite tricky," said Page.
"We've got a kind of two-year
delay. The new people are hav-
ing to sort themselves out and
then get the confidence to do
things."
According to Cochrane there
is both "nervousness as to who
the people who are going to be
spending money are" and wor-
ries about funding for capital
projects as the new authorities
are looking at PF1. "Anything
where local authorities had
their finger in the pie is proba-
bly now a problem," he said.
Nicholas Groves-Raines
expects the reorganisation will
affect short-term workloads
and has been waiting for a year
to start on the Linlithgow pro-
jcct.

secretary of the Royal Incorpo-
ration of Architects in Scotland

By James Fisher
abour MP Bemie Grant and
black construction industry
professionals have launched a
clients advisory service which
will help with the reconstruc-
tion of South Africa.
Chaired by the Tottenham
MP, the Black International
Construction Organisation
(BICO) has been formed by the
loose affiliation of 90 black and
ethnic minority practitioners
who co-operated on the anti-
racist Building E-Quality cam-
paign (Neius March 29).
BICO member and architect
Elsic Owusu said the group
would give clients access to a
register of "approved" consul-
tants offering multi-discipli-
nary expertise.
She said: "It will be a clients
advisory service with an ethical
and philosophical content tar-
geted at the black and ethnic
minority diaspora around the
world."
Appropriately BICO, a refer-
ence to the murdered black
South African nationalist Steve
B ko, will do its first work in
South Africa at the invitation of
Free State premier Patrick
Lekota, advising on commu-
nity development.
Owusu and other industry
professionals will run seminars,
workshops and conferences as
part of an effort to encourage
community involvement in
South Africa's development
programme, which aims to pro-
vide two million homes in the
next six years.
Approved practices will have
to be black-led and must sign
up to BICO's mission state-
ment, committing them to ethi-
cal behaviour.
Other criteria are experience
of diversity, sustainability and
the involvement of the local

community in development.
Head of the RIBA's Clients
Advisory Service Caroline Colc
said: "We have not had any
clients specifically requesting
black or ethnic minority archi-
tccts, but we do get clients ask-
ing for an understanding of dif-
ferent countries and we would
recommend practices with
experience of those countries."
She said there was nothing in

colour axe to grind," she added.
Chair of the Society of Black
Architects Wilfred Achille of
Mode 1 Architects welcomed
the new organisation.
"Anything which looks posi-
tively at the recruitment of eth-
nic minorities is a good thing,"
he said. "The opportunity to
help in South Africa is..at the
front of many black profession-
als' minds."
