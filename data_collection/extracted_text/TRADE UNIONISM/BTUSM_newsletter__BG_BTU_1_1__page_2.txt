The first thing that must be understood is
RACISM is not a "mental quirk" or a"
psychological flaw" on an individual's part.
Racism is the systematic oppression by one
race on another inother words, the various
forms of social relations, economic explo-
itation, military subjugation, political
subordination, cultural devaluation, demo
psychological violation, sexual degradation,
verbal abuse etc together make up a whole set
of interacting and developing processes
which operate so normally and naturally and
are much a part of the existing institutions
of our society that individuals are
involved and are barely conscious of the
operation.
FRANZ Fanon says "THE RACISTS in a culture
with racism is therefore normal"
OR
Black people in Britain, and particularly in
the Trade Union movement, find themselves
confronted by institutional and individual
racism and it is for this reason that
B.T.U.S.M. has been set up.
When blacks in the Trade Union Movement talk
about RACISM the immediate and instructive
reaction of the average white person and the
white extremist or fascist is far sounder
then that of the white liberal or self
appointed black leader. For these average
whites react to our call for black demands.
by simply and honestly ie affirming "WHITE
POWER". Their immediate concern is not
civil rights (which are after all only the
common rights which should be guaranteed
by everyone by the state and it laws),
but with power.
They recognize instinctively that once the
issue of power is raised, it means one set
of people who are powerless replacing
another set of people who have power.
It is something that we must make or take
from those in power.
Many Trade Unior officials and members
consider themselves politically aware.
I believe that some of the founders of
political theory had they been alive
they would have no problems facing the
contradictions which have developed,
отоп
since their original analysis.
I consider it the responsibility of the
Trade Union and Labour movement to
advance these theories to meet today's
historical situation in which black people
are raising their demands within the British
Trade Union meovement..
Most black and white workers are still
using the slogans "Black and White
Unite and Fight", Despite the slavish
allegiance to the concept of Black and
White had common issues and grievances.
This seems an evasion of the scientific
question of which workers they are
calling on, as it reinforces the average
white workers to cling to white power and
bring out quilt in the white liberals.
To us in B.T.U.S.M. it is quite clear
that most white workers in Britain are
like the petty bourgeoisie of MARX'S
time and they collaborate with the power
structure and support the system because
their high standard of living depends on
the continual oppression of black people
through the power structure of our society.
They find it quite natural to exh. rt blacks.
to intergrate into white society and the
white power structure but cannot conceive
of it's being the other way around.
The Trade Union Labour Movement is no
exception to the process of large organis-
ations advancing through the exploitation
of the disadvantaged and deprived people
in our society..
