BACKGROUND
The
Black
International
Construction
Organisation (BICO) is a UK based voluntary
organisation which has emerged out of the desire
of black professionals to assist in articulating the
development agenda of particular groups both in
the UK, and internationally. We aim to contribute
positively to the development work that is already
underway in inner city areas in the UK, and in
African, Caribbean, and Pacific countries by
working in partnership with governments, the
private sector, community-based organisations,
and individuals with a special emphasis on
disadvantaged groups.
HISTORY
In March 1995 a group of Black professionals
from the construction industry in the UK launched
a paper entitled Building E = Quality.
Quality. At the
launch a specialist group articulated the need to
extend this theme towards the United Kingdom's
International Development Programme.

Unstoppable world urbanisation is now a reality.
The planet's urban population is expected to
double in the next twenty years. In 1990 only
15% of the 6.1 billion strong human race lived in
urban areas. By the year 2030 city dwellers will
make up 66% of the population. 90% of this
massive growth will occur in the developing
world.
It is in fulfilment of this need, and in highlighting
the very important dimension of culture in social
as well economic development that BICO will
play a role.
We propose to do this by adopting the two
concepts of the 'EVOLUTIVE ETHOS', and the
concept of ' THE WIN-WIN PHILOSOPHY'
"To fail to plan is to plan to fail" "
